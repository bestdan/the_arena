# AGENTS: player_characters/

Use this when updating the roster. Keep entries consistent so sessions can reference them quickly.

## Load This Context First
- `AGENTS.md` for global rules.
- `player_characters/characters.md` as the source of truth.

## Update Rules
- Track status: active, absent, injured, dead, or freed; note session references.
- Record class/role, notable fighting style, and crowd perception.
- Capture ongoing arcs (debts, patron ties, rivalries) using Obsidian wiki-link syntax to reference sessions or NPCs.
- Keep notes concise and scannable; avoid duplicating prose from sessions.
