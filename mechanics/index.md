## Design Philosophy

These mechanics ensure that **how** you fight matters as much as whether you win:

- **Risk/Reward Balance**: Panache creates meaningful tactical choices
- **Audience Integration**: The crowd is a mechanical participant, not just flavor
- **Consequence Management**: Real stakes with dramatic payoffs
- **Showmanship Incentives**: Style and spectacle are mechanically rewarded

All mechanics are designed to work seamlessly with D&D 2024 5e core rules while emphasizing the campaign's theatrical, gladiatorial tone.
