# Crowd's Favor

While there are other ways to gain or lose favor, the most predictable is rolling with [Panache](panache.md). A successful `with Panache` roll will generally gain you one favor... a **failed** Panache roll with a natural result of 5 **or lower** (before modifiers) causes **–1 Favor**.

### 🔥 Hot Crowd 🔥

After **3 consecutive successful** Panache rolls, the crowd becomes **Hot** for that combatant:

- All further **with Panache** rolls gain **+2**.

- Hot status ends immediately when the combatant **loses any Favor**.
