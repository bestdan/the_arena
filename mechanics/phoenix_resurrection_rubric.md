# Phoenix Resurrection Rubric

**Used for:** The Rite of Phoenix Flames (Session 4) and similar guaranteed-death exhibitions with selective resurrection.

## Core Concept

The Phoenix doesn't just judge who dies well—it judges who **engaged with the crowd**. The resurrection rubric rewards gladiators who used [[crowds_favor|Crowd's Favor]] to create drama, not those who merely hoarded it.

## Drama Score Calculation

Each gladiator's worthiness is measured by their **Drama Score**:

```
Drama Score = (Spent Favor × 2) + Retained Favor
```

**Components:**
- **Spent Favor:** Total Favor spent during combat on abilities, assists, and dramatic actions
- **Retained Favor:** Favor remaining at death (never spent)
- **Multiplier Rationale:** Spending Favor creates spectacle and shows mastery of the crowd. Hoarding Favor shows caution but not showmanship.

### Tracking During Combat

The GM must track both:
1. **Current Favor** (visible to players, changes as they gain/spend)
2. **Total Favor Spent** (running tally, announce periodically)

Example tracking:

| Gladiator | Current Favor | Spent Favor | Drama Score |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| Kael      | 8             | 12          | (12×2) + 8 = **32** |
| Zara      | 15            | 6           | (6×2) + 15 = **27** |
| PC3       | 3             | 18          | (18×2) + 3 = **39** |

## Resurrection Determination

### Primary Rule: Lowest Drama Dies

**The gladiator with the lowest Drama Score does not resurrect.**

This ensures:
- Death has consequences (stakes matter)
- Teamwork is rewarded (spending Favor to help others)
- Engagement is valued over passivity
- The crowd's investment determines survival

### Edge Cases

**Tied for Lowest Drama:**
If multiple gladiators tie for lowest:
1. **Dramatic Choice (Recommended):** The Phoenix demands a choice. The Grand Master, Snak, or a patron must choose who lives. This creates RP opportunity and consequences.
2. **Random Selection:** Roll dice among tied gladiators.
3. **Multiple Deaths (Harsh):** If only 2-3 gladiators tied at lowest, both/all may stay dead (harsh but memorable).

**Important:** Session 4 expects exactly 7 survivors out of 8. If using option 3, ensure total deaths don't exceed 1-2, or be prepared to adjust the narrative expectations.

**Suspiciously Low Drama Across the Board:**
If **no one** reaches the minimum engagement threshold (Drama below 15 for everyone), it indicates the group didn't engage with the mechanics:
- At least **one** still resurrects (most dramatic death, GM choice) to maintain the "7 out of 8" expectation
- Others may resurrect with severe consequences (exhaustion, stat damage, debt)
- Snak and patrons are disappointed

**Everyone High Drama:**
If all gladiators score well (25+ Drama each):
- Default: Still, lowest score stays dead (Phoenix is absolute) to maintain exactly 7 survivors
- OR: GM may allow all to resurrect if Drama scores are exceptionally close (within 3 points) and all above 30, adjusting Session 4 narrative to "all 8 return"
- This should be rare—combat is designed to create separation

## Thresholds and Benchmarks

These aren't hard cutoffs for resurrection, but guidelines for "good performance":

| Drama Score | Assessment | Typical Behavior |
|-------------|------------|------------------|
| 0-8         | **Passive** | Hoarded Favor, minimal engagement, didn't spend on teammates |
| 9-15        | **Adequate** | Used some abilities, balanced retention and spending |
| 16-24       | **Engaged** | Active participant, spent on self and others, took risks |
| 25-35       | **Dramatic** | Heavy Favor usage, spectacular moments, crowd darling |
| 36+         | **Legendary** | Maximum engagement, incredible showmanship, unforgettable |

**Expected Range:** Most gladiators should score 15-30 Drama by session end if playing actively.

## Resurrection Quality (For Survivors)

Based on Drama Score, not just Favor retained. The seven who resurrect get quality scaled to their Drama:

**0-15 Drama:**
- Basic resurrection
- Return with 1 level of exhaustion (lasts until next long rest)
- Equipment intact but damaged (cosmetic)
- "The Phoenix grants you return... barely."

**16-24 Drama:**
- Clean resurrection
- Full HP, no exhaustion
- Equipment repaired and polished
- "The Phoenix acknowledges your efforts."

**25-35 Drama:**
- Resurrection with vigor
- Full HP, no exhaustion
- Advantage on first attack or save next session
- Equipment enhanced (minor cosmetic upgrade)
- "The Phoenix rewards those who embrace the spectacle!"

**36-45 Drama:**
- Phoenix blessing
- Full HP, no exhaustion
- Choose one permanent boon:
  - +1 to a single skill proficiency
  - +5 max HP
  - Phoenix Trinket (grants 1 reroll per long rest)
- Equipment blessed (glows faintly in firelight)
- "The Phoenix marks you as worthy!"

**46+ Drama:**
- Champion of the Phoenix
- All benefits of 36-45 tier
- Phoenix Mark (visible tattoo/brand that grants advantage on Intimidation or Performance checks when visible)
- The crowd knows your name—+2 to all future Favor gains for next three sessions
- "BEHOLD! A CHAMPION REBORN!"

## GM Guidance

### Announce Drama Regularly

Don't wait until the end to calculate Drama. Call it out:
- "Kael spends 2 Favor for Bold Stance—that's 10 total spent, 6 retained, 26 Drama!"
- "Zara's at 15 retained but only 4 spent—that's 23 Drama. She's falling behind!"

### Encourage Spending

If a player is hoarding Favor:
- Remind them spending creates Drama
- Narrate NPC allies spending Favor dramatically
- Have announcer call out "cautious" fighters

### Warn the Low Scorers

Around Round 5-6, give a warning:
- Announcer: "Some fight with CAUTION! Will the Phoenix reward TIMIDITY?"
- Snak (telepathic message if she has that ability): "You're dying anyway—spend it or lose it forever!"
- NPC ally: "Stop hoarding! Make them remember you!"

### Track Visibly

Use a visible tracker or call out Drama scores after major moments. Players should always know roughly where they stand.

### Respect Player Choice

Some players may choose to hoard—respect that. The consequences (potential permanent death) are clearly communicated. If they choose safety over spectacle and pay the price, that's a valid tragedy.

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: The Hoarder
**Fennec:** Ends combat with 18 retained Favor, 4 spent
- Drama = (4 × 2) + 18 = **26**
- Assessment: Played cautiously, banked Favor "just in case"
- Risk: If others scored 27+, Fennec might be the lowest and stay dead despite having highest retained Favor

### Scenario 2: The Showboat
**Zara:** Ends combat with 3 retained Favor, 21 spent
- Drama = (21 × 2) + 3 = **45**
- Assessment: Went all-out, used every trick, helped allies, created incredible moments
- Result: Likely top Drama score, Phoenix Champion tier resurrection

### Scenario 3: The Balanced Fighter
**Kael:** Ends combat with 12 retained Favor, 12 spent
- Drama = (12 × 2) + 12 = **36**
- Assessment: Smart play, used Favor when it mattered, kept reserve for emergencies
- Result: Solid Drama, Phoenix Blessing tier

### Scenario 4: The Unfortunate
**PC:** Ends combat with 7 retained Favor, 5 spent
- Drama = (5 × 2) + 7 = **17**
- Assessment: Didn't engage much with mechanics, died quickly, or had bad luck
- Risk: Likely lowest Drama unless others also struggled

## Why This System Works

1. **Rewards Engagement:** Players who use the mechanics get rewarded
2. **Values Risk-Taking:** Spending Favor on dramatic actions is safer than hoarding
3. **Encourages Teamwork:** Spending Favor on allies increases Drama
4. **Maintains Stakes:** Someone still dies (usually)
5. **Measurable:** Clear math, easy to track
6. **Flexible:** GM can adjust thresholds based on party behavior

## Integration with Session 4

In [[sessions/session_4/session_4_encounter|Session 4: The Rite of Phoenix Flames]], this rubric replaces the simple "lowest Favor" rule mentioned in the original encounter notes.

**Key Change:**
- OLD: "Whoever ends with lowest Favor does not resurrect"
- NEW: "Whoever ends with lowest Drama Score does not resurrect"

The Drama Score system better reflects the philosophy that the Phoenix rewards those who engage with the crowd and create spectacle, not those who merely survive longer.

## Post-Session Debrief

After applying this rubric, discuss with players:
- Show them the full Drama calculations
- Explain why the Phoenix chose as it did
- Celebrate high Drama moments
- Acknowledge that hoarding Favor is a valid strategy—but risky in resurrection events
- Preview that future Rites (if any) will use same system

**Designer Notes:** This system was created to solve the problem that final Favor count doesn't reflect total engagement. A player who earned 30 Favor but spent 25 of it (Drama 55) should be valued over a player who earned 15 and spent none (Drama 15), because the former created spectacle and used the mechanics. The 2× multiplier on spent Favor ensures spending is always better than hoarding from a Drama perspective.
