# AGENTS: mechanics/

Use this when creating or tuning homebrew rules. Keep mechanics punchy, lethal, and easy to table-run.

## Load This Context First
- `AGENTS.md` for global tone.
- Nearby mechanics you might touch: `panache_mechanics.md`, `crowds_favor_mechanic.md`, `last_stand.md`.
- If a rule targets a session arc, skim the relevant `sessions/*.md` for fit.

## Writing Rules
- Prioritize clarity: state trigger, effect, resolution steps, and tracking needs.
- Keep balance anchored in 5e core; lean risky but avoid opaque math.
- Add short usage examples or callouts when edge cases exist.
- Show when crowd reaction or style matters; flag Panache/Crowd Favor hooks explicitly.
- Cross-link other rules and sessions using Obsidian wiki-link syntax; avoid duplicating text across files.
