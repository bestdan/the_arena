# Panache

When a combatant attempts an attack, check, or similar action, they may declare they are performing it **with Panache**. 

They should briefly describe their flashy or daring maneuver.

If they succeed, they are likely to win the [Crowds Favor](crowds_favor.md)

### **Rolling with Panache**

- Roll **2d20**.
- Use the die **farther from 10** (distance = |roll – 10|).
- If the action already has **advantage**, roll 3d20 and **drop the lowest** before resolving Panache.
- If it has **disadvantage**, roll 3d20 and **drop the highest** before resolving Panache.
