# Last Stand

A creature at **0 hit points** who would make a **death saving throw** may choose to activate **Last Stand** instead. This choice is voluntary and irrevocable.

When a creature activates Last Stand, apply the following rules.

## Activation

* The creature immediately stands (no movement required) with **1 hit point**.
* The creature becomes **immune to being reduced below 1 hit point** until the end of its next turn.
* At the **end of its next turn**, the creature **dies instantly**. This death **cannot be prevented, delayed, or reversed** by any means, including spells such as *revivify*, *raise dead*, *resurrection*, *true resurrection*, or *wish*.

## Last Stand Benefits

These benefits last until the end of the creature’s next turn.

**Full Action Surge**
The creature gains **one additional Action** on both its current turn and its next turn.
This additional Action stacks with class features such as Action Surge.

**Ignore Mortality**
The creature’s hit point total **cannot be reduced below 1** while Last Stand is active.
Damage is still tracked normally but cannot cause unconsciousness or death until the effect ends.

**Break the Line**
* The creature’s speed increases by **20 feet**.
* The creature’s movement **does not provoke opportunity attacks**.

**Critical Rampage**
* All attack rolls made by the creature **score a critical hit on a hit**.
* Whenever the creature forces another creature to make a saving throw, that save is made **with disadvantage**.

## Final Gift

When Last Stand is activated, the creature chooses **one** of the following effects. The chosen effect begins immediately and lasts until the end of the creature’s next turn unless otherwise specified.

### Rallying Surge
* Each ally of the creature within **30 feet** regains hit points equal to  
  **10 + (4 x the activating creature’s level)**.
* Each affected ally gains **advantage on its next attack roll or saving throw** (the ally chooses which).

### Guardian’s Favor
* Each ally of the creature within **30 feet** gains **resistance to all damage**.
* One ally of the creature’s choice within 30 feet gains **temporary hit points equal to twice the activating creature’s level**.

### Final Command
* Each ally within **30 feet** may immediately use its **reaction** to either move up to half its speed or make one **weapon attack**.
* Until the end of the activating creature’s next turn, all allies within 30 feet gain a **+2 bonus to attack rolls and saving throws**.
