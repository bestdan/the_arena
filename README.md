# The Arena

A D&D 5e gladiatorial campaign set in Tarsus, where spectacle shapes survival and showmanship matters as much as steel.

## Campaign Overview

**The Arena** is a theatrical, high-stakes gladiatorial campaign inspired by the hunger-games format—repeatable, deadly combat encounters where participants fight for glory, patronage, and their lives. Set in the massive coliseum at the heart of Tarsus, capital of a vast and ancient empire, players take on the roles of gladiators who must:

- **Survive brutal arena battles** against monsters, condemned criminals, and other gladiators
- **Entertain the crowd** through dramatic combat and showmanship—style matters as much as victory
- **Earn fame and patronage** from wealthy nobles and powerful benefactors
- **Navigate dangerous politics** between bouts, making allies and enemies among Tarsus's elite
- **Fight for freedom** by becoming too valuable, too famous, or too beloved to remain enslaved

### The Premise

You've been thrown into The Arena—whether as a prisoner of war, a criminal, a volunteer seeking glory, or someone with nowhere else to go. The Arena is Tarsus's largest structure, a massive 200-foot coliseum that serves as both execution ground and entertainment venue. It's where the empire processes its unwanted and refines a rare few into celebrities.

Survival isn't enough. You must **perform**. The crowd, the patrons, the sponsors—they decide your fate as much as your blade does. Win with flair, earn their favor, and you might live to fight another day. Win enough times, with enough style, and you might even earn your freedom.

### Session Structure (Repeatable Format)

Each session follows a hunger-games-inspired cycle:

1. **Between Bouts** - Downtime, NPC interactions, patron meetings, injuries healing, rumors spreading
2. **The Announcement** - Theatrical introduction with announcer flair and crowd reactions
3. **The Battle** - Deadly combat (balanced for 4-6 PCs) featuring unique arena layouts, monsters, hazards, and objectives
4. **The Aftermath** - Consequences, rewards, patron interest, reputation shifts, injuries, deaths

The format is repeatable but never repetitive—each bout features different terrain, different foes, different stakes, and different opportunities for dramatic moments.

### Key Campaign Features

- **Active Roster System**: ~6 player characters rotate, typically 4 per session, allowing for realistic consequences (injuries, deaths) without ending the campaign
- **Real Stakes**: Death is permanent; injuries have consequences; choices matter
- **Showmanship Mechanics**: Custom systems reward dramatic combat and crowd engagement
- **Path to Freedom**: Fame, patronage, and reputation create multiple routes out of the arena
- **Theatrical Tone**: Announcer interludes, crowd reactions, and high-drama moments shape every bout

## Custom Mechanics

The campaign features homebrew systems that reinforce the theatrical, consequence-driven gameplay:

- **[[panache_mechanics|Panache]]** (`mechanics/panache_mechanics.md`) - Mechanical rewards for showmanship and style in combat
- **[[crowds_favor_mechanic|Crowd's Favor]]** (`mechanics/crowds_favor_mechanic.md`) - The audience becomes an active participant, influencing outcomes
- **[[last_stand|Last Stand]]** (`mechanics/last_stand.md`) - Dramatic final moments with mechanical benefits when a gladiator falls

These mechanics ensure that *how* you fight matters as much as whether you win.

## AI Support for GMs

This repository is designed to work seamlessly with AI assistants (Claude, GitHub Copilot, etc.) for brainstorming and session management.

### Brainstorming New Encounters

The `ideas/` folder contains 30+ encounter concepts ready to be developed into full sessions. Each idea includes:
- Arena layout and terrain features
- Enemy rosters with scaling options
- Crowd hooks and announcer moments
- Aftermath seeds for patron interest

AI agents can help:
- Generate new encounter concepts following the established format
- Develop ideas into full session write-ups with stat blocks
- Create announcer dialogue and crowd reaction beats
- Design terrain features and hazards that encourage dramatic moments

### Running Sessions

AI support for active gameplay:
- Quick NPC dialogue generation in the campaign's theatrical voice
- On-the-fly encounter adjustments based on party composition
- Patron interaction and political intrigue development
- Tracking injuries, reputation, and continuity between sessions

### Repository Structure

```

Each folder has its own `AGENTS.md` with specialized instructions for that content type, ensuring AI assistants maintain consistency in tone, mechanics, and campaign continuity.

### Getting Started with AI Support

1. **Load context**: Start with `/AGENTS.md` plus `environment/the_empire.md` for baseline understanding
2. **Check mechanics**: Reference the three core homebrew systems for integration opportunities
3. **Maintain tone**: Keep the theatrical, announcer-style voice and show consequences visibly
4. **Track continuity**: Injuries, deaths, patron relationships, and reputation matter across sessions
5. **Use wiki links**: Connect content with Obsidian-style wiki links for easy navigation

The campaign is built for collaboration between human creativity and AI assistance, letting GMs focus on player interactions while AI handles content generation, consistency checks, and rapid iteration on encounter design.
