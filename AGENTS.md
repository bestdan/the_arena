# AGENTS: The Arena

LLM operators start here. Keep edits inside `The_Arena/`. Favor writing to Markdown files, linking with Obsidian wiki-link syntax, and preserving the campaign's theatrical, consequences-matter tone.

## Quickstart Context
- Load this file plus `environment/the_empire.md` for baseline lore and arena framing.
- Mechanics to keep handy: `mechanics/panache_mechanics.md`, `mechanics/crowds_favor_mechanic.md`, `mechanics/last_stand.md`.
- for details about the physical arena itself, see `environment/arena_details.md`
- Cast snapshot: `player_characters/characters.md`; key NPC sheets live in `npcs/`.
- When editing a folder, check its local `AGENTS.md` for scoped instructions.

## Campaign Snapshot (for light-weight context)
- Premise: D&D 5e "core rules" gladiatorial saga in Tarsus; Arena blends spectacle with lethal advancement.
- Active roster rotates ~6 PCs, usually 4 per session.
- Themes: showmanship shapes fate; teamwork vs. solo glory; real stakes; fame and patronage as path to freedom.
- Tone: high-drama combat, announcer flair, crowd as character.

## Repo Map (load on demand)
- `sessions/` - session setups/encounters (narrative-first). See `sessions/AGENTS.md`.
- `mechanics/` - homebrew systems. See `mechanics/AGENTS.md`.
- `ideas/` - brainstorm seeds. See `ideas/AGENTS.md`.
- `npcs/` - NPC sheets. See `npcs/AGENTS.md`.
- `player_characters/` - PC tracking. See `player_characters/AGENTS.md`.
- `CLAUDE.md` - legacy all-in-one brief; prefer the sharded guides above for tighter context windows.

## Working Rules for All Agents
- Stay in-universe: crowd reactions, announcer interludes, and consequences should show up in scenes.
- Track continuity: injuries, deaths, patron interest, reputation shifts.
- Keep mechanics visible when they matter (Panache, Crowd’s Favor, Last Stand).
- Default to concise prose; add minimal headings and bullets for clarity.

## When to Use Claude Code Skill
- Multi-file rewrites or structural edits (session flow, mechanics refactors, link audits).
- Generating or updating scaffolds (new `AGENTS.md`, session templates, encounter stat blocks).
- Fast consistency passes (renaming links, aligning format) while keeping narrative tone intact.
