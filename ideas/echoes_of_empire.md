# Echoes of Empire

- **Hook:** "Walk the BATTLEFIELDS OF HISTORY!" The arena magically reconstructs three legendary battles from Tarsus's imperial history, shifting between them every 2 rounds. Each battlefield offers different terrain, cover, and tactical advantages. The enemies are historical re-enactments—elite soldiers from different eras who know their home terrain intimately. The crowd watches as gladiators face the empire's greatest military moments simultaneously.
- **Party:** 4-6 PCs, level 5+. Tests tactical adaptability, use of historical terrain features, and ability to fight enemies optimized for specific battlefields.

## Opening Presentation
- Before combat, arena announcer presents the three historical battlefields:
  - **"First—The Battle of Crimson Fields! Where we crushed the northern barbarians!"** (open grassland with burning wagons)
  - **"Second—The Siege of Ironwall Keep! Our finest defensive hour!"** (fortress courtyard with walls and murder holes)
  - **"Third—The Shipbreaker's Cove! Where we claimed the southern seas!"** (beached warship wreckage and tidal pools)
- Large tapestries depicting each battle hang above arena; they glow when that battlefield is active.
- PCs learn rotation: Crimson Fields → Ironwall Keep → Shipbreaker's Cove → repeat every 2 rounds.

## Battlefield Rotation (100-foot diameter, shifts every 2 rounds)

### Crimson Fields (Rounds 1-2, 7-8, 13-14)
**"Open grassland battlefield where cavalry dominated"**
- **Terrain:** Flat grassland with trampled paths, scattered bodies (cosmetic), 4 burning siege wagons (20 feet tall).
- **Burning Wagons:** Provide full cover but deal 1d6 fire damage to adjacent creatures (5-foot aura). Can be used for dramatic jumps/slides.
- **Cavalry Advantage:** Open ground favors mobility; enemies with horses move faster.
- **Fire Hazard:** Grass occasionally catches fire (spreads 10 feet per round, 2d6 fire damage to creatures in flames).
- **Tactical Note:** Best battlefield for ranged combat and mobile strikers; poor for defenders.

**Environmental Features:**
- Four burning wagons positioned in cardinal directions (N, S, E, W from center).
- Grass fire starts if fire spell cast or wagon knocked over.
- Clear sightlines—no hiding, all combat visible to crowd.

### Ironwall Keep (Rounds 3-4, 9-10, 15-16)
**"Fortress courtyard where defenders held against overwhelming odds"**
- **Terrain:** Stone courtyard with 15-foot walls on two sides, central tower (30 feet tall), narrow passages.
- **Walls:** Climbable (Athletics DC 12); creatures on walls have high ground advantage (+2 to attack rolls).
- **Murder Holes:** Slots in walls allow ranged attacks from cover (enemies use these strategically).
- **Chokepoints:** Two 10-foot-wide gates force combat into narrow corridors (limits large creature mobility).
- **Tactical Note:** Best battlefield for defenders and area denial; favors crowd control spells.

**Environmental Features:**
- Central tower has ladder inside (climable to top, overlooks entire battlefield).
- Two gates on opposite walls (can be closed with portcullis—Athletics DC 15 to lift).
- Murder holes provide three-quarters cover for ranged attackers.
- Oil pots on walls (bonus action to tip if adjacent to wall; creates 10-foot square flaming hazard for 3 rounds, 3d6 fire damage on entry).

### Shipbreaker's Cove (Rounds 5-6, 11-12, 17-18)
**"Coastal battlefield where naval forces clashed in shallow water"**
- **Terrain:** Half land, half water—beached warship (40 feet long), tidal pools, rocky outcroppings.
- **Tidal Pools:** Waist-deep water (difficult terrain, swim speed helpful).
- **Warship Wreckage:** Tilted deck provides ramps, below-decks chambers, cargo nets (Athletics DC 10 to climb).
- **Rocky Cover:** Barnacle-covered rocks provide half cover (sharp—1d4 slashing if climbed carelessly).
- **Tactical Note:** Mixed terrain favors versatile parties; water slows melee, wreckage provides vertical options.

**Environmental Features:**
- Warship deck tilted 30 degrees (Dex DC 12 to move without sliding).
- Cargo nets allow swinging between ship and rocks (Athletics DC 10).
- Below-decks chambers provide full cover but tight quarters (10×10-foot rooms).
- Barnacle rocks deal 1d4 slashing if used as cover without protection.

## Battlefield Shift Mechanic
- **At Initiative Count 20 on even-numbered rounds:** Reality flickers, battlefield transforms.
- **Warning:** At initiative count 10 the round BEFORE shift, announcer gives 6-second warning: "HISTORY TURNS! New ground approaches!"
- **Positional Translation:** 
  - Open ground (Crimson) → becomes courtyard (Ironwall) or ship deck (Cove)
  - Wall top (Ironwall) → becomes wagon roof (Crimson) or ship mast (Cove)
  - Water (Cove) → becomes grassland (Crimson) or courtyard (Ironwall)
- **Adaptation:** PCs on advantageous terrain (walls, high ground) try to maintain position through shifts; enemies do the same.

## Enemies (historical elite forces, rotate with battlefields)

### Crimson Fields Enemies (Cavalry Legion)
**"The Red Hussars—fastest cavalry in imperial history"**
- **2 Mounted Knights** (CR 3 each; lances, charge attacks, warhorse trampling).
  - Advantage on Crimson Fields: +10 movement speed, charge deals +2d6 damage.
  - Disadvantage on Ironwall: Horses can't navigate walls/stairs, dismount (lose charge).
  - Disadvantage on Shipbreaker: Horses struggle in water (half speed), disadvantage on attacks.
  
- **3 Mounted Archers** (use Scout stat block; shortbows, mobile hit-and-run).
  - Advantage on Crimson Fields: +10 movement speed, bonus action Dash.
  - Disadvantage on Ironwall: Tight spaces limit mobility.
  - Disadvantage on Shipbreaker: Water slows horses (half speed).

### Ironwall Keep Enemies (Fortress Defenders)
**"The Ironwall Guard—defenders who held for 30 days"**
- **2 Tower Sentinels** (use Veteran stat block; heavy crossbows, shield bash).
  - Advantage on Ironwall: Start on walls (high ground), murder hole cover.
  - Disadvantage on Crimson: No cover, exposed.
  - Disadvantage on Shipbreaker: Heavy armor disadvantage in water.

- **1 Siege Captain** (use Knight stat block; tactical commands, rally allies).
  - Advantage on Ironwall: Bonus action to command ally attack (Help action at range).
  - Disadvantage on Crimson: No fortifications to leverage.
  - Disadvantage on Shipbreaker: Water terrain limits heavy tactics.

- **2 Oil Bombardiers** (use Thug stat block; flask attacks, fire tactics).
  - Advantage on Ironwall: Can tip oil pots from walls (3d6 fire, 10-foot radius).
  - Disadvantage on Crimson: Limited fire sources (only wagons).
  - Disadvantage on Shipbreaker: Oil flasks less effective in water (half damage).

### Shipbreaker's Cove Enemies (Naval Marines)
**"The Sea Reavers—marines who never lost a boarding action"**
- **2 Boarding Axemen** (use Berserker stat block; reckless attacks, climbing).
  - Advantage on Shipbreaker: Swim speed 30, advantage on Athletics (climb rigging).
  - Disadvantage on Crimson: Open ground exposes reckless attacks.
  - Disadvantage on Ironwall: Fortress tactics foreign to naval fighters.

- **2 Harpoon Gunners** (use Scout stat block; harpoon attacks pull targets, nets).
  - Advantage on Shipbreaker: Harpoon attacks pull targets into water (Strength DC 14 or pulled 15 feet).
  - Disadvantage on Crimson: No water hazards to exploit.
  - Disadvantage on Ironwall: Walls block harpoon pulls.

- **1 Tide Caller** (use Priest stat block; water-based spells, healing).
  - Advantage on Shipbreaker: *control water*, *create water*, healing enhanced in water (+1d8).
  - Disadvantage on Crimson: Dry environment limits water spells.
  - Disadvantage on Ironwall: Stone walls block water flow.

**Flex:** For 4 PCs, remove 1 Mounted Knight, 1 Tower Sentinel, and 1 Boarding Axeman. For 6 PCs, add 1 Gladiator (CR 5) who fights effectively on all three battlefields (no advantages/disadvantages).

## Tactical Adaptation
- **Enemy Strategy:** Enemies attempt to stall combat until their favored battlefield:
  - Cavalry Legion tries to disengage and kite on Ironwall/Shipbreaker, waiting for Crimson Fields return.
  - Fortress Defenders hold chokepoints on Crimson, stall until Ironwall Keep returns.
  - Naval Marines retreat to below-decks on other battlefields, burst out during Shipbreaker's Cove.

- **Terrain Exploitation:** Each enemy group knows their terrain:
  - Cavalry herds PCs into fire hazards on Crimson Fields.
  - Defenders seal gates and use murder holes on Ironwall Keep.
  - Marines pull PCs into water and harpoon them to ship wreckage on Shipbreaker's Cove.

## Crowd Favor Hooks
- Defeat an enemy on their home battlefield (Cavalry on Crimson, Defenders on Ironwall, Marines on Shipbreaker): +2 [[crowds_favor|Favor]] for beating them at their own game.
- Use environmental feature to kill enemy (push into fire, drop from walls, drown in tidal pool): +2 Favor per environmental kill.
- Maintain high ground advantage across all three battlefields: +2 Favor for tactical superiority.
- Adapt combat style to each battlefield (ranged on Crimson, defensive on Ironwall, mobile on Shipbreaker): +1 Favor for versatility.
- [[panache|Panache]] strike timed with battlefield shift (kill as terrain changes): +3 Favor for dramatic timing.
- Close/seal Ironwall gate to trap enemies outside: +2 Favor for tactical control.
- Swing from ship rigging to attack multiple enemies: +2 Favor for acrobatic spectacle.
- Survive being harpooned and pulled into water: +1 Favor for resilience.

## Announcer Beats
- **Opening:** "HISTORY LIVES! Three battlefields! One proving ground! Can they conquer the empire's LEGENDS?!"
- **First shift (Crimson → Ironwall):** "The fields become FORTRESS! Stone rises! Defend or DIE!"
- **Ironwall → Shipbreaker:** "Walls FLOOD! The sea claims all! Board the wreckage or DROWN!"
- **Shipbreaker → Crimson:** "Waves become GRASS! The plains return! CAVALRY CHARGES!"
- **Enemy home advantage:** "The Hussars SURGE on home ground! This is THEIR field!"
- **Environmental kill:** "Crushed by the portcullis! Ironwall CLAIMS another!"
- **Tactical adaptation:** "She learns! She shifts tactics! From bow to blade to shield! MASTERY!"
- **Victory:** "They've walked through HISTORY and emerged VICTORIOUS! The empire bows to its own past!"

## GM Tips
- **Visual Maps:** Use three different battle mats or VTT presets, swap at initiative 20 every 2 rounds.
- **Enemy Positioning Reset:** When battlefield shifts, translate enemy positions logically (cavalry on open ground stay mobile, defenders seek walls).
- **Historical Flair:** Narrate shifts as "echoes"—"You hear ghostly cavalry charges," "The smell of saltwater and burning tar."
- **Terrain Mastery:** Reward PCs who learn each battlefield's advantages after first cycle.
- **Enemy Morale:** Enemies fight harder on home battlefields (advantage on morale saves).
- **Rotation Tracking:** Display battlefield order visibly: Crimson (red) → Ironwall (gray) → Shipbreaker (blue).
- **Environmental Damage:** Make fire, falling, and drowning feel dangerous but survivable (warning before lethal damage).

## Aftermath Seeds
- **Historical Recognition:** PCs who won on all three battlefields gain "Battlefield Legend" title—recognized by military veterans across Tarsus, advantage on Charisma checks with soldiers.
- **Patron Interest:** Imperial war college impressed by "tactical flexibility"; offers military contract to quell rebellion (high pay, high risk).
- **Rumor:** The battlefields were powered by ghostly echoes of actual soldiers—binding souls to arena is illegal necromancy. PCs might be approached by authorities investigating these claims, or by families seeking closure.
- **Downtime:** Historical weapons from each battlefield can be claimed: Red Hussar Lance (+1 lance), Ironwall Shield (+1 shield with *wall of stone* 1/day), Sea Reaver Harpoon (+1 trident with pull effect).
- **Injury:** PC knocked unconscious on Shipbreaker's Cove develops lingering "sea sickness"—disadvantage on saves vs. nausea/poison for 1d4 days.
- **Legendary Moment:** If PCs adapted tactics perfectly to each battlefield, military scholars request interview for tactical manual (fame bonus: +1 to Charisma checks in Tarsus).
- **Political:** Arena's use of historical battles offends some noble houses whose ancestors died there—threaten boycott or demand PCs apologize.
