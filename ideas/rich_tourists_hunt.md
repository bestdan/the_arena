# Rich Tourists Hunt

- **Hook:** Decadent nobles from Tarsus's wealthiest estates have paid a fortune for the thrill of "the hunt." They descend into the Arena armed with their finest magical weapons and enchanted trinkets to hunt the gladiators like game. The twist: kill a noble, claim their treasures. The crowd roars for blood—preferably theirs.
- **Party:** 4-6 PCs, level 3-5. High risk, high reward; every noble carries magical items worth dying for.

## Arena Layout
- Sprawling 150-foot "hunting grounds" themed like a noble's estate garden: hedge mazes (10 feet high, thick cover), marble fountains (half cover, can be shattered for difficult terrain), ornamental statues (full cover), and manicured topiaries.
- Three elevated "hunter's blinds" (15 feet high) on wooden platforms—nobles start here with bows and crossbows, forcing gladiators to close distance or find cover.
- Central trophy pavilion with gilded pillars; reaching it grants line-of-sight advantage but makes you visible to all hunters.
- Scattered "bait stations": weapon racks with basic arms, fruit baskets (1d4+1 HP if consumed as bonus action), but approaching triggers tripwires that alert nearby nobles.

## The Nobles (The Hunters)
These aren't warriors—they're wealthy dilettantes with too much gold and too little sense. But their gear makes them deadly.

### Standard Noble Hunter (use Noble stat block, CR 1/8, but adjust)
- **AC 15** (enchanted silk doublet, acts as Bracers of Defense)
- **HP 12** (cowards at heart)
- **Attacks:** *+1 Rapier* (1d8+4 piercing) or *+1 Hand Crossbow* (1d6+4 piercing, range 30/120)
- **Coward's Retreat:** If reduced below half HP, uses action to Dash toward nearest exit, screaming for guards.
- **Loot:** Each carries one minor magical item (roll or choose from table below).

### Lead Huntmaster - Lord Valerius Crane (use Knight with modifications, CR 3)
- **AC 18** (*+1 Half Plate* with gold filigree)
- **HP 65** (well-fed, but trained in fencing)
- **Attacks:** *+2 Longsword* (1d8+5 slashing, or 1d10+5 two-handed) or *+1 Longbow* (1d8+4 piercing, range 150/600)
- **Huntmaster's Command (Recharge 5-6):** As bonus action, directs two nobles to focus fire on one target; they gain advantage on their next attack against that target.
- **Trophy Obsessed:** Will not flee; fights to the death for "the perfect kill." If defeated, screams theatrically: "I'll be remembered... forever!"
- **Loot:** *+2 Longsword*, *Cloak of Protection*, *Potion of Greater Healing*, ornate signet ring (worth 200gp), and a scroll of *Misty Step*.

### Contingent Size
- **4 PCs:** 4 Noble Hunters + Lord Valerius
- **5 PCs:** 5 Noble Hunters + Lord Valerius + 1 Bodyguard (use Veteran, CR 3, loyal to Valerius; no magical loot but carries a *Potion of Heroism*)
- **6 PCs:** 6 Noble Hunters + Lord Valerius + 2 Bodyguards

## Noble Hunters Loot Table (roll d10 per noble or choose)
1. *+1 Dagger* (jeweled hilt, worth 250gp if sold)
2. *Ring of Jumping*
3. *Cloak of Billowing* (useless but dramatic; crowd loves it)
4. *+1 Leather Armor* (dyed purple, smells of lavender)
5. *Wand of Magic Missiles* (3 charges, regains 1d3 at dawn)
6. *Potion of Healing* x2
7. *Boots of Elvenkind*
8. *Eversmoking Bottle*
9. *Goggles of Night*
10. *Bag of Tricks* (tan)

## Objectives
- **Primary:** Survive the hunt. Killing nobles is optional but encouraged—loot incentivizes risk.
- **Secondary:** Claim Lord Valerius's trophy sword. First to land the killing blow earns crowd adoration (and the loot).
- **Tertiary:** Protect any fallen ally long enough for them to stabilize—nobles will coup de grâce downed gladiators for "sport."

## Crowd Favor Hooks
- **Kill a noble in melee with Panache:** +2 Favor (the crowd delights in seeing the hunters become the hunted).
- **Steal a noble's weapon mid-combat (Disarm):** +1 Favor, roaring laughter from the stands.
- **Use a noble's own magical item against them:** +2 Favor (dramatic irony at its finest).
- **Survive being reduced to 0 HP via [[Last Stand]], then kill the noble who downed you:** +3 Favor (legendary moment).
- **Reach the trophy pavilion and declare a challenge (taunt all nobles):** +1 Favor, but all nobles focus fire on you for 1 round.

## Hazards and Tricks
- **Tripwire Alarms:** Hidden near bait stations (DC 13 Perception to spot, DC 15 Dex save to avoid). Failure alerts nobles within 60 feet, who shout "Fresh prey spotted!" and converge.
- **Hedge Maze Dead Ends:** Some paths loop back or end in walls; navigating requires DC 12 Survival check or waste movement.
- **Shatter Fountains:** Destroying a fountain (15 HP, AC 12) creates 10-foot radius difficult terrain from rubble and floods the area with 1 foot of water—slows nobles in heavy armor (half movement).
- **Ornamental Statues:** Can be toppled (DC 15 Athletics) onto a creature within 5 feet; target takes 2d6 bludgeoning and is knocked prone (DC 13 Dex save halves, no prone).

## Noble Tactics
- **Start Cautious:** Nobles begin 60+ feet away, taking potshots from hunter's blinds. They won't rush in—they expect gladiators to come to them.
- **Panic When Pressured:** First noble to drop triggers morale crisis. Remaining nobles make DC 12 Wisdom save or waste their action shooting wildly (disadvantage on attacks).
- **Lord Valerius Commands:** Uses Huntmaster's Command to coordinate fire. Prioritizes flashy targets (anyone with high Favor or visible magic items).
- **Bodyguards Intercept:** If present, they rush forward to block line-of-sight to Valerius, shoving gladiators back (contested Athletics).

## Announcer Beats
- **Opening:** "Lords and ladies, merchants and mongrels—tonight we reverse the hunt! Our finest from the estates of Tarsus grace the sands, armed with treasures beyond your wildest dreams! Will our gladiators claim their fortune... or become trophies themselves?"
- **First Noble Falls:** "And THERE goes Lord Marcellus! His enchanted blade... now in the hands of a SLAVE! How the mighty have stumbled!"
- **Mid-Fight Twist:** "Lord Valerius demands SINGLE COMBAT! Will any dare face the Huntmaster alone?" (Valerius shouts challenge; if accepted, all combatants pause for 1 round to watch the duel. Winning grants +3 Favor.)
- **Finale:** "The hunt is OVER! The nobles scatter like quail! WHO WILL CLAIM THE FINAL PRIZE?"

## GM Tips
- **Encourage Greed:** Dangle the loot. Describe the glint of enchanted steel, the shimmer of magical cloaks. Make players *want* to take risks.
- **Play Up Noble Cowardice:** When bloodied, nobles whimper, beg, offer ransoms ("I'll make you RICH! Ten thousand gold!"). The crowd boos if PCs show mercy—this is about reversing roles.
- **Track Loot Visibly:** When a noble dies, announce their loot immediately. Let players decide who claims what *in the moment*, mid-combat.
- **Valerius's Last Stand:** If cornered, he fights desperately, screaming about legacy and glory. His death should feel like slaying a mini-boss—give it weight.
- **Crowd Turns on Nobles:** If gladiators are dominating, the crowd begins chanting "HUNTERS! COWARDS! RUN!" Nobles make all attacks at disadvantage for 1 round from distraction.

## Aftermath Seeds
- **Patron Interest:** A senator who bet *against* the nobles approaches the PCs. "You've embarrassed some very powerful people. I like that. Let's talk."
- **Noble Vengeance:** Surviving nobles (or their families) plot revenge—future encounters with hired assassins or sabotage.
- **Black Market Buzz:** Word spreads that the gladiators have high-quality loot. Thieves, fences, and collectors approach with offers (or threats).
- **Crowd Chant:** If PCs dominated, they earn a nickname: "The Trophy Hunters," "Noble Slayers," or similar. Announcer uses it in future bouts.

## Possible Twists
- **Surprise Reinforcements:** Midway through, a noble blows a hunting horn. 2 trained **Mastiffs** (use Wolves, CR 1/4) rush in from side gates—they focus on downed gladiators.
- **Magical Trap Activation:** Lord Valerius carries a *Wand of Web* (3 charges). If cornered, he uses it to trap gladiators, then repositions.
- **Bribe Attempt:** A bloodied noble offers their magical item to a PC in exchange for protection. If accepted, crowd *loses* Favor (–2) for perceived cowardice. If rejected and executed, +2 Favor.
- **Crowd Throws Weapons:** If PCs are struggling, the crowd (rooting for gladiators) tosses basic weapons or daggers into the arena. They land near PCs (DM discretion).

## Notes for Downtime
- **Loot Distribution:** Encourage PCs to claim trophies immediately. No "waiting until after"—this is gladiatorial theater. Who grabs what matters for narrative and mechanics.
- **[[Crowd's Favor]] Integration:** This session is built for Favor. Nobles are weak but lucrative; players must balance survival with spectacle.
- **[[Panache]] Opportunities Everywhere:** Disarming nobles, using their weapons, theatrical kills—reward creativity generously.
