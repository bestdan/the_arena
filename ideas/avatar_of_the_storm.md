# Avatar of the Storm

- **Hook:** Storm giants' emissary descends with thunder—challenging Tarsus to prove mortals worthy of the giants' notice. Lightning splits the sky; the crowd cowers beneath the tempest.
- **Party:** 4-6 PCs, level 11-13. Lightning damage, flying enemies, and environmental chaos.

## Arena Layout
- Open-air colosseum (150-foot diameter) with storm clouds swirling overhead—periodic lightning strikes (initiative 10) hit random 10-foot area, 4d10 lightning, Dex DC 16 half.
- Three metal conductors (30-foot tall iron poles)—standing within 10 feet attracts lightning (auto-hit, 6d10 lightning) but can be used to redirect strikes (Athletics check DC 18 to aim at enemy).
- Torrential rain creates difficult terrain (entire floor) and imposes disadvantage on Perception checks.
- Howling winds (initiative 20): ranged attacks beyond 60 feet at disadvantage; flying creatures must succeed DC 14 Strength save or drift 20 feet in random direction.

## Enemies (storm giant champion plus aerial host)
- 1 **Storm Giant** (CR 13)—wields greatsword crackling with lightning, throws lightning bolts at range (120 feet, +14 to hit, 4d12 lightning).
- 2 **Air Elementals** (CR 5)—whirlwind minions, grapple and lift PCs into storm.
- 4 **Storm Herald Aarakocra** (reskin Aarakocra with +2 Con, 1d6 lightning damage on dive attack)—aerial harassment, divebomb tactics.
- **Flex:** For 4 PCs, remove 1 Air Elemental and 2 Aarakocra; storm giant starts with 100 HP expended. For 6 PCs, add 1 **Djinni** (CR 11) as giant's ally and increase lightning strike frequency to every round.

## Storm Giant Tactics
- **Opening:** Throws lightning bolts at range, Air Elementals advance to grapple casters/archers.
- **Mid-Fight:** Closes to melee, greatsword sweeps (Str save DC 17 or knocked prone on crit), uses legendary actions to reposition.
- **Bloodied (115 HP):** Calls down focused lightning storm (action)—three lightning strikes target PCs in metal armor or near conductors.
- **Critical (60 HP):** Desperation—throws greatsword like javelin (150 feet, returns next turn) or grapples strongest PC to hurl into storm clouds (fall 100 feet, 10d6 damage + 4d10 lightning).

## Crowd Favor Hooks
- Redirecting a conductor's lightning strike to hit storm giant: +3 Favor.
- Surviving being grappled by Air Elemental and lifted into storm (escape or ally rescue): +2 Favor.
- Catching storm giant's thrown greatsword mid-flight (Dex save DC 20 or Athletics check DC 18): +4 Favor ("IMPOSSIBLE!").
- Using [[panaches]] to surf on Air Elemental or ride lightning bolt (DM discretion): +3 Favor on success.
- Landing melee hit on storm giant while standing in storm (taking lightning auto-hit): +2 Favor for bravery.

## Hazards and Elemental Synergies
- Lightning strikes: random targeting unless PCs wear metal armor (prioritized) or stand near conductors.
- Conductors: can be toppled (Athletics DC 20, requires 2 PCs or 1 Strength 20+)—crashes into 20-foot line, 3d10 bludgeoning, Dex DC 15 half.
- Rain + lightning: all creatures in water (puddles form in low spots) take +1d6 lightning from strikes.
- Wind gusts: can be used tactically—PCs with flight or *levitate* can "surf" winds to reposition (Acrobatics DC 14).

## Announcer Beats
- Opening: "THE STORM GIANT DESCENDS! Witness the fury of the heavens—can mortal steel stand against THUNDER AND LIGHTNING?"
- First lightning strike: "THE SKY SPLITS! Did you see that bolt? One step to the left and that gladiator would be CHAR!"
- Air Elemental lifts PC: "UP! UP INTO THE STORM! Will they fall—or will their allies SAVE THEM?"
- Storm giant bloodied: "GIANT'S BLOOD! The emissary falters—PRESS THE ATTACK!"
- Finale: "THE STORM BREAKS! The giant yields—TARSUS HAS PROVEN WORTHY!" (victory) or "The storm claims all... kneel before the tempest..." (defeat).

## GM Tips
- Lightning strikes should feel dangerous but cinematic—telegraph with rumbling, crowd pointing skyward, NPC warnings.
- Storm giant should speak in booming voice: "PROVE YOUR WORTH, MORTALS!" "THE STORM SEES ALL!" "YOU FIGHT WELL—BUT CAN YOU ENDURE?"
- If PCs struggle, let giant offer honorable yield ("You have earned my respect—live and grow stronger."); converts to patron/ally.
- Use conductors strategically—reward clever redirection with auto-hits on giant (skip attack roll, just damage).
- Use [[last_stand]] when giant throws PC into storm—sacrifice to save them or heroic solo finish.

## Aftermath Seeds
- Victory: Storm giant's respect—offers alliance with storm giant clan (future quests, weather-control boons).
- Loot: *Greatsword of the Storm*—+2, deals +2d6 lightning, can cast *call lightning* 1/day.
- Defeat: Storm giant takes PCs as "students" for 1 month—harsh training montage (stat boosts, weather resistance).
- Divine attention: Sky deity (Zeus-analog) observes—grants blessing or curse based on performance.
- Arena legacy: future sessions in "Storm Arena" with permanent weather hazards and conductor mechanics.
