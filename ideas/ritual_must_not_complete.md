# The Ritual Must Not Complete

- **Hook:** Cultist prisoners perform a "dark ritual" in the arena's center—a theatrical spectacle for the crowd. The gladiators must disrupt it before completion. Five ritual circles glow with eldritch power; each one activated brings doom closer. Let too many complete, and the "demon" (heavily armored champion) manifests at full power. Interrupt them all, and face only a weakened foe.
- **Party:** 4-6 PCs, level 5-6. Emphasizes multi-target pressure, crowd control, and resource management under time limit.

## Arena Layout
- Circular arena, 100-foot diameter, with central sacrificial altar.
- Five ritual circles (15-foot radius each) positioned at pentagon points around the altar, 40 feet from center.
- Each circle glows with purple runes; cultists channel power at these locations.
- Scattered pillars and braziers provide cover and tactical options.
- Altar contains a locked iron cage (the "demon champion" waits inside until summoned).

## Attrition Mechanics
- **Completion Limit:** If **4 or more circles** complete their rituals, the demon manifests at overwhelming power.
- **Ritual Completion:** Each circle requires **3 rounds of uninterrupted channeling** by at least one cultist. If cultist is killed or moved, ritual resets.
- **Graduated Consequences:**
  - 0 circles completed: Demon manifests at 50% HP, disadvantage on attacks, no legendary actions. +5 Favor to all.
  - 1 circle completed: Demon at 65% HP, normal attacks, 1 legendary resistance. +4 Favor.
  - 2 circles completed: Demon at 80% HP, normal attacks, 2 legendary resistances. +3 Favor.
  - 3 circles completed: Demon at 100% HP, normal attacks, 3 legendary resistances, 1 legendary action/round. +2 Favor.
  - 4+ circles completed: Demon at 150% HP, advantage on attacks, 3 legendary resistances, 2 legendary actions/round. +0 Favor, crowd fears the champions may die.
- **Tracking:** Use tokens or markers to show ritual progress (0/3, 1/3, 2/3, 3/3 per circle).

## Enemies (cultist defenders)
**Phase 1 - The Channelers (Rounds 1-6):**
- 5 Cultists (CR 1/8), one at each ritual circle, begin channeling immediately.
- 2 Cult Fanatics (CR 2) roam between circles, defending cultists and attempting to complete rituals if cultists die.
- 3 Guard Drakes (CR 2) patrol, attacking any PCs who approach circles.
- Flex: 4 PCs = remove 1 Guard Drake. 6 PCs = add 1 Cult Fanatic and 2 Shadows stalking from darkness.

**Phase 2 - The Demon Manifests (After 6 rounds or when 3+ circles complete):**
- The cage bursts open; the "demon" emerges (use Bone Devil or Horned Devil stats, CR 9, scaled as noted above).
- Any surviving cultists flee or prostrate themselves, no longer threats.
- Demon's power level depends on completed circles (see Graduated Consequences).

## Ritual Completion Tracking
- **Round 1:** All 5 cultists begin channeling (0/3 progress at each circle).
- **Round 2:** Unchallenged cultists advance to 1/3 progress.
- **Round 3:** Unchallenged cultists advance to 2/3 progress.
- **Round 4:** First circle may complete (3/3) if unchallenged; cultist moves to assist another circle or defends.
- **Rounds 5-6:** Race against time; PCs must disrupt or accept consequences.
- **Round 7:** Demon automatically manifests regardless of circle count (creates urgency).

## Objectives
- **Primary:** Prevent 4 or more circles from completing before Round 7.
- **Secondary:** Face the weakest possible demon by stopping all 5 circles (aspirational).
- **Bonus:** Defeat the demon without any PC dropping to 0 HP (+2 Favor to all).

## Crowd Favor Hooks
- Disrupt a ritual at 2/3 progress with a killing blow: +2 Favor.
- Stop a Cult Fanatic from reaching an undefended circle: +1 Favor.
- Destroy a completed circle's runes with creative solution (acid, radiant damage, dispel magic): +2 Favor.
- Declare [[panaches|Panache]] attack while interrupting ritual: +2 Favor if successful.
- Coordinate simultaneous disruption of 2+ circles in same round: +2 Favor to each PC involved.
- Single PC holds off multiple enemies while allies disrupt circles: +2 Favor.
- Face the demon at 50% HP or lower (0 circles): +5 Favor total (shared).

## Hazards and Tactical Options
- **Ritual Circles:** Standing in active circle during channeling = 1d6 necrotic damage at start of turn (Dex DC 14 negates).
- **Braziers:** Can be tipped to create fire zones (2d6 damage); interrupts ritual if cultist stands in it.
- **Pillars:** Provide full cover; can be used for hit-and-run tactics.
- **Altar:** Can be climbed (15 feet high) for elevated vantage; attacking from here grants height advantage but makes PC visible target.
- **Completed Circles:** Glow brightly; demon draws power from them. Can be dispelled (DC 16 Arcana check as action) even after completion to weaken demon.

## Announcer Beats
- Opening: "The ritual begins! Five circles of damnation! Will our champions stop the summoning—or face the FULL FURY of the abyss?!"
- First circle completes: "ONE CIRCLE IGNITES! The demon stirs! Blood on the sands!"
- Third circle completes: "THREE! The barrier weakens! The beast HUNGERS!"
- Demon manifests (weak): "It emerges—but WEAKENED! Our champions have CRIPPLED the ritual!"
- Demon manifests (strong): "BEHOLD THE BEAST AT FULL POWER! RUN, CHAMPIONS! Or STAND AND DIE GLORIOUSLY!"
- Ritual disruption: "A cultist falls! The circle BREAKS! Well struck!"
- Victory: "The demon is BANISHED! The ritual UNDONE! Tarsus TRIUMPHS!"

## GM Tips
- Track ritual progress visibly; create countdown urgency ("That circle is almost complete!").
- Cultists should shout ritual incantations; describe eldritch energy building for atmosphere.
- If PCs ignore a circle, have it complete quickly; don't punish smart prioritization but reward coverage.
- Cult Fanatics can dash to undefended circles, forcing PCs to split attention.
- Demon entrance should be DRAMATIC: cage explodes, smoke billows, announcer screams.
- Scale demon HP/abilities based on completed circles; don't TPK but make 4+ circles terrifying.
- If PC uses [[last_stand|Last Stand]] during demon fight: +3 Favor, crowd goes absolutely wild.
- Consider letting crowd throw holy water or silver weapons if PCs earn high Favor early.

## Aftermath Seeds
- **0 Circles Completed:** Temple patron impressed; "You disrupted dark magic with precision. We need you."
- **3+ Circles Completed:** Whispers of "they barely survived"; rival gladiators see weakness to exploit.
- **Demon Slain:** Demon's "essence" (prop) awarded as trophy; grants reputation boost with anti-cult factions.
- **Ritual Knowledge:** PCs who succeeded on Arcana checks gain insight; potential plot hook about real cult outside arena.
- **Downtime:** Access to "cleansed" ritual components (minor magical items, holy symbols) as rewards.
- **Injury:** PC who took most hits from demon gains "Hellmarked" scar; crowd recognizes them as demon-slayer.
- **Patron Interest:** Noble who wagered heavily on outcome (win or lose) seeks private audience.

## Variant: Reverse Attrition
For a twist, run this with PCs as cultists completing rituals while guards try to stop them. Defender gladiators attack, and PCs earn Favor based on how many circles THEY complete. Inverts the dynamic while keeping attrition tension.
