# Wings of Fire

- **Hook:** A young dragon—barely past wyrmling age but already arrogant—demands "tribute in blood." The arena offers substitution: let gladiators test the dragon's pride. Scales versus steel, breath versus courage.
- **Party:** 4-6 PCs, level 5-7 (Young Dragon tier). High mobility, breath weapon timing, and lair-action pressure.

## Arena Layout
- Cliffside amphitheater (100-foot diameter, open sky above)—dragon can fly freely; PCs start on rocky outcrop.
- Central dragon's perch (30-foot pillar of stone, 20 feet high)—dragon claims it as "throne"; attacking while it's perched provokes legendary action swipe.
- Scattered boulders (5-10 feet wide) provide full cover but can be toppled (Athletics DC 15) to create difficult terrain or improvised attacks.
- Three ballista emplacements (edge of arena, pre-loaded)—PCs can man them (action to aim, action to fire; +6 to hit, 3d10 piercing; 3 bolts each).
- Wind gusts (lair action, initiative 20): dragon's wingbeats create 30-foot cone of gale force; Strength save DC 14 or pushed 15 feet and knocked prone.

## Enemies (dragon tyrant plus aerial support)
- 1 **Young Red Dragon** (CR 10, fire breath) OR **Young Blue Dragon** (CR 9, lightning breath) OR **Young Green Dragon** (CR 8, poison breath)—choose based on desired difficulty and flavor.
  - **Variant Options:**
    - Red: Aggressive, lands to claw/bite combatants, breath recharges frequently.
    - Blue: Tactical, stays airborne longer, uses lightning breath to chain through metal-armored PCs.
    - Green: Cunning, breathes poison cloud over cover, uses *suggestion* (innate) to turn PCs against each other.
- 2 **Wyverns** (CR 6) or **Dragonborn Knights** (reskin Gladiators with +2 Str, breath weapon 1/short rest, 2d6 damage)—dragon's "honor guard."
- **Flex:** For 4 PCs, use **Young Copper Dragon** (CR 7, lower HP) and 1 Wyvern. For 6 PCs, upgrade to **Young Gold Dragon** (CR 10, high AC) and add 2 **Kobold Inventors** (CR 1/4) with fire-breath traps.

## Dragon Tactics
- **Rounds 1-2:** Strafe breath weapon from sky, targeting clustered PCs. Honor guard engages melee combatants.
- **Round 3-4:** Land on perch, use legendary actions (tail attack, wing attack to reposition). Breath recharges—unleash again.
- **Bloodied (half HP):** Enraged—switches to sustained melee, claw/claw/bite full attacks. Lair actions intensify (wind gusts every round).
- **Critical (25% HP):** Desperation flight—attempts to flee or crashes into arena wall, creating rubble hazard (4d10 bludgeoning, Dex DC 15 half, 20-foot radius).

## Crowd Favor Hooks
- First PC to land a ballista bolt hit: +2 Favor.
- Surviving dragon's breath weapon at point-blank range (within 5 feet of origin): +3 Favor.
- Toppling a boulder onto dragon while it's grounded: +2 Favor (requires coordination or high Strength).
- Climbing onto dragon's back mid-flight and attacking (requires grapple check): +4 Favor ("dragonrider gladiator!").
- Using [[panache_mechanics]] to taunt dragon into landing (Intimidation or Performance check, DC 16): +2 Favor on success.

## Hazards and Lair Actions
- **Wind Gusts (Initiative 20):** 30-foot cone from dragon's position; Str save DC 14 or pushed 15 feet and prone. Can knock PCs off perch or into boulders.
- **Falling Rocks (Initiative 10):** Dragon's weight cracks perch; anyone standing on it makes Dex save DC 13 or falls 20 feet (2d6 damage).
- **Breath Weapon Recharge:** Roll at start of dragon's turn; on 5-6, it recharges. Crowd gasps when they see dragon inhale.

## Announcer Beats
- Opening: "BEHOLD—WINGS OF FIRE! The dragon has come to claim tribute... will our champions offer their LIVES or their VICTORY?"
- First breath weapon: "THE SKY BURNS! Can mortal flesh withstand dragonfire?!"
- Dragon lands: "It descends—NOW is the chance to strike!"
- Dragon bloodied: "BLOOD! Dragon blood! The wyrm is MORTAL after all!"
- Finale: "The dragon FALLS—Tarsus stands unburned!" (victory) or "Ashes and cinders—the dragon's tribute is PAID!" (defeat).

## GM Tips
- Breath weapon is devastating—telegraph with dragon rearing head, crowd murmuring, or NPC shouting "SCATTER!"
- Let PCs use environment: ballistae are clutch, boulders provide necessary cover against breath.
- Dragon should monologue: "I am FIRE incarnate!" "You dare challenge a DRAGON?" "Your bones will adorn my hoard!"
- If TPK imminent, dragon may accept yield ("You fought well, mortals—LIVE, and tell of my mercy."); converts to patron/rival dynamic.
- Use [[last_stand]] against breath weapon—one PC absorbs full blast to save others, dies heroically.
- Adjust dragon age category for party level: Wyrmling (CR 4) for level 3-4, Young (CR 7-10) for 5-7, Adult (CR 13+) for 8-10.

## Aftermath Seeds
- Victory: Dragon hoard access (partial—arena takes cut). Include magic item: *Dragon Scale Armor*, *Dragonslayer Longsword +1*, or gemstones worth 2,000 gp.
- Defeat: Dragon takes one PC as "servant" for 1 year (plot hook for rescue or servitude arc).
- Honor guard survival: Wyverns or Dragonborn Knights swear fealty to PCs after "fair fight."
- Cult reaction: Draconic cult in Tarsus outraged—future assassination attempts or challenges from dragon-worshippers.
- Dragon lives (fled): Becomes recurring nemesis, growing stronger (returns as Adult or Ancient later in campaign).
