# Wings of Fire: The Ultimate Silkwing

- **Hook:** The arena masters unveil their newest acquisition—a chimeric horror called the Ultimate Silkwing. Born from forbidden magic, this multi-element dragon has never been defeated. The crowd demands blood. The dragon demands prey. Five gladiators must prove that even the ultimate weapon can fall.
- **Party:** 5 PCs, level 3. Focus on creative tactics, environmental use, and exploiting the dragon's weak points. This is a deadly encounter that rewards clever play.

## Arena Layout
- Cliffside amphitheater (100-foot diameter, open sky above)—the Silkwing can fly freely; PCs start on rocky outcrop with scattered cover.
- Central stone pillar (20 feet high, 10 feet wide)—the Silkwing perches here initially, surveying its prey from above.
- Scattered boulders and rubble (5-10 feet wide) provide half or full cover. Can be used as improvised weapons (Athletics DC 13) or climbing points.
- Two ballista emplacements (opposite sides of arena, pre-loaded)—PCs can man them (action to aim, action to fire; +5 to hit, 3d10 piercing; 2 bolts each). Effective against flying target.
- Wooden scaffolding along arena walls (15 feet high)—allows PCs to reach higher elevation, but only 10 HP and AC 12. Breaking scaffolding while Silkwing is near can cause it to crash (Dex save DC 13 or fall 15 feet).
- Lightning scorch marks on the ground from previous battles—hint at the dragon's breath weapon.

## The Enemy: Ultimate Silkwing
- 1 **[[utlimate_silkwing|Ultimate Silkwing]]** (CR 5, 136 HP)—see full statblock in linked file.
  - **Key Features:**
    - Fire slam (right arm), poison darts (left arm), lightning breath, scorpion tail
    - Weak spot on top of head (AC 12, +2d6 damage on hit)
    - Tremor-Tantrum when bloodied (earthquake ability + enrage)
    - Prefers flying, uses Tail Sweep reaction to punish approaches
  - **Solo Boss:** No minions—this is a solo deadly encounter. The Silkwing's action economy and AOE abilities balance against 5 level 3 PCs.

## Silkwing Tactics
- **Round 1:** Perched start—unleash lightning breath down the center line where PCs cluster. Immediately take flight.
- **Rounds 2-3:** Stay airborne at 40-60 feet. Strafe with poison darts (targeting casters/archers). Use Tail Sweep reaction on anyone who climbs scaffolding or uses ballista. Wait for lightning breath recharge.
- **Round 4 (or when bloodied):** Land dramatically, trigger Tremor-Tantrum. Knock everyone prone, create difficult terrain. Now enraged with advantage on attacks.
- **Rounds 5+:** Aggressive multiattack every turn. Focus fire slam on whoever hit the weak spot (if any). Use scorpion tail to paralyze healers/supports. If lightning breath recharges, use it immediately.
- **Desperate (below 30 HP):** Either attempt to flee (straight up into sky) or crash into scaffolding to bring it down on PCs (4d6 bludgeoning, Dex DC 14 half).

## Crowd Favor Hooks
- First PC to land a ballista bolt hit: +2 Favor
- Hit the Silkwing's head weak spot: +3 Favor
- Called shot to the eye (with [[panache]]): +4 Favor
- Survive direct hit from lightning breath (fail save but stay conscious): +2 Favor
- Stay standing through Tremor-Tantrum (successful save): +2 Favor
- Grapple or climb onto the Silkwing mid-flight: +3 Favor ("DRAGONRIDER!")
- Using [[panache]] to distract Silkwing (give ally advantage): +2 Favor
- Land killing blow with improvised/environmental attack: +3 Favor

## Environmental Hazards
- **Lightning Breath Recharge:** Roll at start of Silkwing's turn; on 5-6, it recharges. Crowd murmurs and points when they see energy crackling around its maw.
- **Tremor-Tantrum Aftermath:** After the earthquake, the ground is difficult terrain in a 30-foot radius. Rubble and cracks make footing treacherous.
- **Collapsing Scaffolding:** Scaffolding has 10 HP, AC 12. If destroyed while Silkwing is within 10 feet, it must make Dex save DC 13 or take 2d6 bludgeoning damage and fall prone.
- **Falling from Heights:** PCs knocked off scaffolding or pillar take 1d6 per 10 feet fallen. Silkwing can knock PCs off with Fire Slam's prone effect or wind from its wings.

## Announcer Beats
- **Opening:** "CITIZENS OF TARSUS! Tonight, you witness the ULTIMATE predator! Fire! Poison! LIGHTNING! The Silkwing has never known defeat... will FIVE brave souls be enough?!"
- **First Lightning Breath:** "THE SKIES TEAR OPEN! Can mortal flesh withstand LIGHTNING INCARNATE?!"
- **Weak Spot Hit:** "A STRIKE TO THE HEAD! The beast BLEEDS! Perhaps it CAN be slain!"
- **Tremor-Tantrum:** "THE EARTH ITSELF TREMBLES! The Silkwing is ENRAGED—now the TRUE battle begins!"
- **Silkwing Bloodied:** "ICHOR! Dragon blood stains the sand! The ULTIMATE weapon is MORTAL after all!"
- **Victory:** "IMPOSSIBLE! The Silkwing FALLS! Five champions stand where LEGENDS could not! REMEMBER THIS DAY!"
- **Defeat:** "Ashes and lightning... the Silkwing claims its prey. Let silence honor the fallen."

## GM Tips
- **Telegraph Everything:** Lightning breath charges with crackling energy, fire slam glows red-hot, poison darts drip green. Give players a chance to react.
- **Weak Spot Discovery:** Let PCs discover it via Investigation (DC 13), [[panache]] taunts that force the Silkwing to look down, or NPC crowd members shouting hints.
- **Use the Environment:** Ballistae are crucial for bringing it down, scaffolding creates vertical combat, boulders save lives from lightning breath.
- **Monologue/Roars:** The Silkwing speaks rarely but dramatically: "You are PREY." "Witness PERFECTION." "I am... inevitable..." (when bloodied).
- **If TPK is Imminent:** Silkwing may accept yield if 3+ PCs are down ("You fought... adequately. LIVE."). Arena masters may intervene with nets or smoke bombs—survival with shame is more interesting than total wipe.
- **Use [[last_stand]]:** Perfect moment is when lightning breath targets multiple downed allies—one PC leaps into the line to save them, dies heroically.
- **Phase 2 Drama:** When Tremor-Tantrum triggers, pause for announcer commentary, describe the Silkwing's transformation (scales brighten, movements quicken, enraged roar).
- **Loot Timing:** If PCs win, Silkwing scales, venom sac, and eye-gem are perfect loot. Scales can craft resistance armor, venom makes 3 paralytic poison doses, eye-gem worth 250 gp.

## Aftermath Seeds
- **Victory:**
  - Loot: Silkwing scales (enough for 1 suit of resistance armor), venom sac (3 paralytic poison doses), eye-gem (250 gp)
  - Fame: Word spreads—"The five who slew the Ultimate Silkwing." Gain patron interest, free drinks, potential sponsorships
  - Arena masters are impressed but wary—what NEXT challenge can match this?
- **Defeat (3+ PCs dead):**
  - Silkwing claims one survivor as "trophy"—PC forced into servitude for 1 year (rescue plot hook)
  - Arena offers resurrection at steep cost (debt/service owed)
  - Crowd remembers the fallen—statues or memorial plaques earn posthumous [[crowds-favor]]
- **Partial Victory (Silkwing flees below 30 HP):**
  - Silkwing escapes, wounded and vengeful—becomes recurring nemesis
  - Arena masters offer bounty to finish the job outside the arena
  - Silkwing's creator (dark mage?) seeks revenge on PCs for damaging their "masterpiece"
- **Cult Reaction:**
  - If Silkwing dies, its creator (dark mage, dragon cultist, or mad artificer) seeks revenge
  - Rival gladiators jealous of PC fame—sabotage or ambushes
- **Campaign Hook:**
  - More chimeric monsters start appearing—who's creating them? Why?
  - Silkwing was a prototype—the REAL Ultimate weapon is still in development
