# Demon Prince's Wager

- **Hook:** A demon lord's lieutenant emerges from a ritual gate—wagering souls against glory. The crowd watches unholy fire scorch the sands. Banish it back to the Abyss, or become eternal thralls.
- **Party:** 4-6 PCs, level 8-10. Fiendish regeneration, fear effects, and demonic reinforcements test resolve.

## Arena Layout
- Cracked obsidian floor (80-foot diameter) with lava fissures bleeding through—stepping on cracks deals 1d6 fire per round (Dex save DC 12 to avoid).
- Central summoning portal (20-foot diameter)—glows red, pulses every 3 rounds spawning 2 Dretches (CR 1/4).
- Four sacrificial altars (at cardinal points, 5 feet high)—destroying altar (AC 15, 40 HP, immune to fire/poison) weakens demon's regeneration (each broken reduces regen by 3 HP).
- Sulfurous smoke billows (initiative 15): entire arena is lightly obscured; Perception checks at disadvantage, ranged attacks beyond 30 feet at disadvantage.

## Enemies (fiend champion plus demonic horde)
- 1 **Glabrezu** (CR 9, main demon)—4 arms, can cast *confusion*, *darkness*, *dispel magic*. Regenerates 10 HP per round unless altars destroyed.
- 1 **Shadow Demon** (CR 4)—lurks in sulfurous smoke, ambushes with claws and fear aura.
- 4 **Quasits** (CR 1)—invisible scouts, turn visible to poison sting key targets (healers, casters).
- Portal Spawns: 2 **Dretches** emerge every 3 rounds (initiative 20) until portal closed (requires dispel magic DC 15 or dealing 30 radiant damage to it).
- **Flex:** For 4 PCs, replace Glabrezu with **Vrock** (CR 6) and remove Shadow Demon; portal spawns 1 Dretch per round. For 6 PCs, add 1 **Hezrou** (CR 8) ally to Glabrezu and increase portal spawn to 3 Dretches.

## Demon Tactics
- **Opening:** Glabrezu casts *confusion* on clustered PCs; Shadow Demon fear-haunts isolated targets.
- **Mid-Fight:** Quasits poison-sting casters to break concentration; Dretches mob frontliners.
- **Bloodied (half HP):** Glabrezu rages—uses all 4 claw attacks (multiattack) and attempts to grapple/pin strongest PC.
- **Critical (25% HP):** Glabrezu offers pact ("Yield your souls and LIVE!") or goes berserk (*mirror image* + *power word stun* if available).

## Crowd Favor Hooks
- Closing the summoning portal before 6 Dretches spawn: +3 Favor to party (shared).
- Destroying an altar while under demon attack: +2 Favor.
- Resisting *confusion* spell and immediately attacking demon: +2 Favor.
- Landing radiant damage (smite, spell, or holy weapon) on Glabrezu: +1 Favor per instance (crowd loves holy vs. unholy).
- Using [[panache_mechanics]] to mock demon ("Back to the Abyss, fiend!") before killing blow: +3 Favor on success.

## Hazards and Holy Synergies
- Lava fissures: pushing demons into them deals 3d6 fire (Dex save DC 14 half) but demons have resistance; PCs take full damage.
- Sacrificial altars: can be sanctified (cleric/paladin using Channel Divinity)—grants +1d4 radiant to attacks within 10 feet of altar for 1 minute.
- Portal: closing it stops reinforcements but causes backlash—15-foot radius force explosion, 4d6 force, Con save DC 15 half.

## Announcer Beats
- Opening: "From the Abyss itself—a demon prince's champion! Will mortal courage hold against infernal might?"
- Portal spawns: "MORE demons! The gate bleeds corruption—CLOSE IT!"
- Altar destroyed: "The binding weakens! Strike NOW while the fiend falters!"
- Glabrezu offers pact: "Do you hear that? The demon bargains for your SOULS—will they SELL or SLAY?"
- Finale: "BANISHED! The Abyss claims its own—TARSUS STANDS!" (victory) or "Darkness descends... the demon reigns..." (defeat).

## GM Tips
- Emphasize fear/despair: sulfurous smoke chokes, demon taunts ("Your souls are MINE!"), crowd murmurs nervously.
- Portal spawns can overwhelm—give clear altar-destruction cues or NPC shouts ("Break the altars!").
- Glabrezu's pact should tempt: offer wealth, power, or resurrection in exchange for servitude (dramatic RP moment).
- If PCs bring radiant damage, lean into "holy warriors purging evil" narrative—extra Favor and crowd adoration.
- Use [[last_stand]] when demon offers pact—one PC refuses, fights to death to inspire others.

## Aftermath Seeds
- Victory: Demon's glaive (magic weapon: *Glaive of the Abyss*—+1, deals +1d6 necrotic but cursed with bloodlust).
- Defeat: PCs dragged to Abyss; escape quest or fiendish pact to return (dark patron warlock hook).
- Portal remnant: unstable rift remains; future sessions involve sealing it or defending against incursions.
- Cult discovery: demon cult in Tarsus exposed by portal's signature—PCs hunt cultists or are hunted.
- Divine attention: Celestial or god's avatar observes from crowd—offers blessing or quest ("You have proven worthy...").
