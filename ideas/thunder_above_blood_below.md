# Thunder Above, Blood Below

- **Hook:** Storm priests demand tribute; announcer promises "lightning to anoint the brave."
- **Arena Layout:** Elevated metal grates form catwalk spokes from a central tower over blood-slick sand. Lightning rods on each spoke charge every other round; anyone on a rod's 10-foot square saves or takes lightning damage. Metal weapons grant advantage on disarm attempts during surges.

## Encounter (4-6 PCs, mid-tier low level)
- 1 Priest of Talos (or reskinned Cult Fanatic with lightning flavor).
- 4 Reavers (Bandits with lightning rider on first hit after a surge).
- 2 Flying Drakes (use Pteranodon with single lightning breath cone).
- **Flex:** For 4 PCs, remove 1 Drake and 1 Reaver. For 6 PCs, add 1 Berserker bodyguard.
