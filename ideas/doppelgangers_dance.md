# Doppelgangers Dance

- **Hook:** Multiple entrances spit gladiators across a fractured arena. Somewhere in the chaos, doppelgangers wear their faces. Kill every imposter before the imposters kill you—but can you trust your own eyes when the DM smiles?
- **Party:** 4-6 PCs, level 4+. Emphasize role-play, deception, and player-vs-player psychology.

## Arena Layout
- Sprawling maze of stone corridors, canvas partitions, and pillared chambers (150 feet across, irregular shape).
- Five distinct entrance gates (Gate A through E)—each PC enters from a different gate, separated at start.
- Corridors wind and fork; pillars and hanging banners limit line-of-sight to 30 feet max in most areas.
- Three open "meeting chambers" (20x20 feet each) with better sight lines; natural convergence points but exposed.
- Crowd watches from high balconies; they see everything but gladiators see only what's in their immediate corridor.

## Core Mechanic: Dual-Identity Cards
Each player receives **two character cards** at session start:
1. **Their actual PC** (standard sheet).
2. **A doppelganger imposter** pretending to be *another PC in the party*.

Example: Alice plays her PC (Theron the Fighter) **and** plays a doppelganger pretending to be Bob's PC (Kira the Rogue).

### Imposter Rules
- Imposters use Doppelganger stat block (CR 3) modified to look/sound like the PC they're mimicking.
- Imposters have *detect thoughts*, *Read Thoughts* ability, and perfect physical mimicry.
- Players secretly control their imposter's actions when it's "on screen" (DM hands control back and forth).
- Goal for imposters: blend in, sow distrust, isolate and kill real PCs.
- **Win Condition for Imposters:** If more imposters survive than real PCs, patrons withdraw support (narrative loss). If equal numbers survive, it's a stalemate (reduced Favor, mixed patron reactions).

### Trust Mechanics
- No meta-gaming: players can't ask "are you really Kira?" Players must roleplay suspicion based on behavior.
- PCs can use Insight vs. Deception to read behavior (DC 15 baseline; imposter knows PC's backstory via *detect thoughts*).
- Magic like *detect thoughts*, *zone of truth*, or unique PC abilities can expose imposters (but imposters resist cleverly).

## Encounter Setup
- **4 PCs:** 4 real PCs + 4 Doppelgangers (one per PC). Each player controls their PC + 1 imposter of another PC.
- **5 PCs:** 5 real PCs + 5 Doppelgangers.
- **6 PCs:** 6 real PCs + 6 Doppelgangers.
- Doppelgangers start scattered; DM secretly places them in corridors near (but not adjacent to) the PCs they're mimicking.

### Additional Threats (environmental pressure)
- 2-3 **Spectral Hounds** (use Shadow, CR 1/2)—neutral hunters that attack anyone alone; force grouping but grouping increases imposter danger.
- Periodically (every 4 rounds), arena floods one section with **choking fog** (heavily obscured, Constitution save DC 12 or 1d6 poison damage per turn); drives PCs to relocate and regroup.

## Objectives
- **Primary:** Kill all doppelgangers; leave all real PCs alive (or at least 50%+).
- **Secondary:** Identify imposters without killing a real PC (bonus Favor if no friendly fire deaths).
- **Tertiary:** Survive with minimal injuries (patrons reward clean, clever victories).

## Crowd Favor Hooks
- Identify a doppelganger via clever questioning/trap and expose them publicly: +2 [[crowds_favor_mechanic|Favor]].
- Kill a doppelganger with [[panache_mechanics|Panache]] after unmasking it: +2 Favor.
- Rescue a real PC from an imposter's ambush: +1 Favor to both.
- Survive a 1v1 imposter encounter and defeat it solo: +2 Favor.
- Convince the party you're real when they suspect you (successful Deception/Persuasion): +1 Favor.
- Accidentally attack a real PC but immediately de-escalate: +1 Favor for restraint.
- Work with an "unknown ally" (who turns out to be real) to corner an imposter: +1 Favor to both.

## Tactical Elements
- **Separation Anxiety:** Alone, you're vulnerable to Spectral Hounds; together, imposters blend in and sabotage.
- **Behavioral Tells:** Players controlling imposters should roleplay subtle "off" moments (wrong spell choice, misremembering lore, hesitation).
- **Magic Verification:** *Detect thoughts*, *zone of truth*, unique class features (a real Paladin's Divine Sense, a real Wizard's spellbook) can confirm identity.
- **Environmental Pressure:** Fog zones force movement; Spectral Hounds punish stragglers; meeting chambers expose groups to sneak attacks.
- **Imposter Gambit:** Imposters can reveal themselves dramatically (drop disguise, use *Surprise Attack* for advantage) for tactical advantage but lose blending potential.

## Hazards and Twists
- **Choking Fog Zones:** Heavily obscured, Constitution save DC 12 at start of turn or 1d6 poison damage. Rotates every 4 rounds.
- **Spectral Hounds:** Hunt lone PCs (advantage on attacks vs. isolated targets). Can be distracted or killed (18 HP each).
- **Locked Gate Twist (Round 5):** One exit gate unlocks early; announcer taunts: "The coward's door opens! Flee now or prove your worth!" Leaving early = disgrace (lose all Favor, patron interest drops).

## Announcer Beats
- Opening: "From five gates, five champions enter! But shadows wear their faces! Who is real? Who is false? **Kill the right ones, gladiators!**"
- First imposter revealed: "UNMASKED! The crowd gasps! But how many more lurk among you?!"
- Friendly fire incident: "Blood spills—ally or enemy? The sands care not! **Trust is a luxury!**"
- Fog activation: "The mists rise! Choke on doubt and poison alike!"
- Final imposter falls: "The last pretender crumbles! Truth stands bloodied but victorious! Tarsus roars!"

## GM Tips
- **Pre-Session Prep:** Print imposter cards for each player; assign secretly (player A controls PC-A + imposter-of-PC-B, etc.). Keep assignments hidden until session.
- **Dual Control Flow:** When an imposter appears on-screen, hand control to its player via private message. Let them roleplay the deception.
- **Encourage Paranoia:** Drop hints (imposter uses wrong weapon, forgets a detail, hesitates oddly). Reward clever detective work.
- **Behavioral Cues:** Imposters should act 90% real, 10% "off." E.g., a cautious PC suddenly charges; a kind PC snaps harshly.
- **Magic Countermeasures:** If a PC uses *detect thoughts* on an imposter, the imposter's player can resist or feed false thoughts (Deception vs. Insight).
- **Balance Spotlight:** Rotate imposter reveals; don't unmask everyone at once. Let tension build.
- **Friendly Fire Mercy:** If a PC attacks another PC, allow saves or reactions to prevent full damage (narrative of "wait, stop!").
- **Spectral Hounds as Timer:** They create urgency; PCs can't dawdle solo to avoid imposters.

## Aftermath Seeds
- **Patron Interest:** Espionage master impressed by paranoia management; offers infiltration contract or information network access.
- **Rumor:** Doppelgangers were planted by a rival arena faction to destabilize Tarsus gladiators; conspiracy brewing.
- **Downtime:** PC who killed an imposter of themselves gains haunting dreams (disadvantage on Wisdom saves for 1d4 days; can be removed via *lesser restoration* or therapy).
- **Injury:** PC who suffered friendly fire damage develops trust issues (disadvantage on Insight checks vs. allies for 1 session).
- **Political:** Crowd debates which PC showed best judgment under deception; patron offers private mentorship to "the clever one."
- **Loot:** Doppelganger corpses yield **Mimicry Dust** (consume to gain advantage on Deception checks to impersonate someone for 1 hour; 1d3 doses, 25 gp each).
