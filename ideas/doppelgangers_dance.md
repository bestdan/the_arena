# Doppelgangers Dance

- **Hook:** Multiple entrances spit gladiators across a fractured arena. Somewhere in the chaos, doppelgangers wear their faces. Kill every imposter before the imposters kill you—but can you trust your own eyes when the DM smiles?
- **Party:** 4-6 PCs, level 4+. Emphasize role-play, deception, and player-vs-player psychology.

## Arena Layout
- Sprawling maze of stone corridors, canvas partitions, and pillared chambers (150 feet across, irregular shape).
- Five distinct entrance gates (Gate A through E)—each PC enters from a different gate, separated at start.
- Corridors wind and fork; pillars and hanging banners limit line-of-sight to 30 feet max in most areas.
- Three open "meeting chambers" (20x20 feet each) with better sight lines; natural convergence points but exposed.
- Crowd watches from high balconies; they see everything but gladiators see only what's in their immediate corridor.

## Core Mechanic: Uncertain Identity System

Each player receives **two character sheets** at session start—but **doesn't know which is real until triggered**.

### Pre-Session Setup (GM Only)
1. Assign each player their actual PC plus one other PC's doppelganger (circular: Alice→Bob, Bob→Carol, Carol→Alice).
2. Create two versions of character sheets per player:
   - **Version A:** "You are [Your PC]. You entered from Gate X. Your goal: survive and eliminate imposters."
   - **Version B:** "You are [Other PC's Name]. You entered from Gate Y. Your goal: survive and eliminate imposters."
3. **Secret Truth:** Mark one version privately as "IMPOSTER" (this is the doppelganger).
4. Give both sheets to the player with no indication which is real; both feel equally legitimate.

### The Revelation Trigger
Players play BOTH characters simultaneously (alternating scenes, split attention) until **an external event reveals the truth**:

**Trigger Examples:**
- Another PC successfully uses *detect thoughts* or *zone of truth* on one of your characters → GM whispers which sheet is the imposter.
- Your character takes damage that would reduce them below half HP → GM signals imposter identity (imposters bleed wrong, flinch oddly, or show unnatural resilience).
- Environmental event: The arena's "truth bell" chimes (Round 4-5) → GM reveals one random PC-player pair's truth via sealed note.
- A character attempts a signature ability tied to the real PC's backstory (e.g., "As a Paladin, I call on my deity") → GM confirms or denies authenticity privately.
- Another player calls out YOUR character as suspicious and succeeds on Insight DC 17+ → GM reveals to the accuser only.

**Before the Trigger:**
- Play both characters as if they're real; use different voices/mannerisms.
- Act on partial information—you don't KNOW who to trust yet, even in your own "heads."
- Roleplay internal confusion: "Wait, why would I doubt myself?" creates delicious paranoia.

**After the Trigger:**
- GM privately signals which sheet is the imposter (note, text, whisper).
- Player continues controlling both BUT now knows the imposter's true goal: sabotage, isolate, kill.
- Player must subtly shift imposter behavior without alerting other players (the performance continues).

### Imposter Rules (Post-Revelation)
- Imposters use modified Doppelganger stat block (CR 3): HP as listed, *detect thoughts*, perfect mimicry, *Surprise Attack* feature.
- Imposters know their target PC's surface thoughts and recent history (via *detect thoughts*).
- **Imposter Win Condition:** If more imposters survive than real PCs, patrons withdraw (narrative loss). Equal numbers = stalemate (reduced Favor).
- **Imposter Tactics:** Blend in, sow distrust ("I think Bob's acting weird..."), isolate real PCs, strike when alone.

### Meta-Gaming Safeguards
- **No Out-of-Game Questions:** Players can't ask "Which sheet is mine?" or "Am I the fake?" DM remains silent until triggers activate.
- **Dual Roleplay Commitment:** Players must engage both characters fully—hesitation on one reveals suspicion.
- **Trigger Fairness:** Ensure every player gets a trigger by Round 5 (use Truth Bell as failsafe). Stagger reveals for maximum tension.
- **DM Signals:** Use private notes/texts for reveals; never announce publicly which character is fake unless dramatically appropriate.
- **Behavioral Prompts:** Give both sheets subtle "personality quirks" to justify slight differences (real PC might seem cautious due to paranoia; imposter might overcompensate with bravado).

## Encounter Setup
- **4 PCs:** 4 real PCs + 4 Doppelgangers (one per PC). Each player controls their PC + 1 imposter of another PC.
- **5 PCs:** 5 real PCs + 5 Doppelgangers.
- **6 PCs:** 6 real PCs + 6 Doppelgangers.
- Doppelgangers start scattered; DM secretly places them in corridors near (but not adjacent to) the PCs they're mimicking.

### Additional Threats (environmental pressure)
- 2-3 **Spectral Hounds** (use Shadow, CR 1/2)—neutral hunters that attack anyone alone; force grouping but grouping increases imposter danger.
- Periodically (every 4 rounds), arena floods one section with **choking fog** (heavily obscured, Constitution save DC 12 or 1d6 poison damage per turn); drives PCs to relocate and regroup.

## Objectives
- **Primary:** Kill all doppelgangers; leave all real PCs alive (or at least 50%+).
- **Secondary:** Identify imposters without killing a real PC (bonus Favor if no friendly fire deaths).
- **Tertiary:** Survive with minimal injuries (patrons reward clean, clever victories).

## Crowd Favor Hooks
- Identify a doppelganger via clever questioning/trap and expose them publicly: +2 [[crowds_favor|Favor]].
- Kill a doppelganger with [[panache|Panache]] after unmasking it: +2 Favor.
- Rescue a real PC from an imposter's ambush: +1 Favor to both.
- Survive a 1v1 imposter encounter and defeat it solo: +2 Favor.
- Convince the party you're real when they suspect you (successful Deception/Persuasion): +1 Favor.
- Accidentally attack a real PC but immediately de-escalate: +1 Favor for restraint.
- Work with an "unknown ally" (who turns out to be real) to corner an imposter: +1 Favor to both.

## Tactical Elements
- **Separation Anxiety:** Alone, you're vulnerable to Spectral Hounds; together, imposters blend in and sabotage.
- **Behavioral Tells:** Players controlling imposters should roleplay subtle "off" moments (wrong spell choice, misremembering lore, hesitation).
- **Magic Verification:** *Detect thoughts*, *zone of truth*, unique class features (a real Paladin's Divine Sense, a real Wizard's spellbook) can confirm identity.
- **Environmental Pressure:** Fog zones force movement; Spectral Hounds punish stragglers; meeting chambers expose groups to sneak attacks.
- **Imposter Gambit:** Imposters can reveal themselves dramatically (drop disguise, use *Surprise Attack* for advantage) for tactical advantage but lose blending potential.

## Hazards and Twists
- **Choking Fog Zones:** Heavily obscured, Constitution save DC 12 at start of turn or 1d6 poison damage. Rotates every 4 rounds.
- **Spectral Hounds:** Hunt lone PCs (advantage on attacks vs. isolated targets). Can be distracted or killed (18 HP each).
- **Locked Gate Twist (Round 5):** One exit gate unlocks early; announcer taunts: "The coward's door opens! Flee now or prove your worth!" Leaving early = disgrace (lose all Favor, patron interest drops).

## Meta-Gaming Analysis & Concerns

**What Makes This Work:**
1. **Genuine Uncertainty:** Players can't meta-game if they don't know which character is "theirs." The psychological investment spreads across both identities.
2. **Distributed Cognitive Load:** GM doesn't run imposters; players do (once revealed). This makes imposter behavior less obviously "NPC-like."
3. **External Triggers:** Revelations come from other players' actions (magic, Insight, combat) or neutral events (Truth Bell), not player self-knowledge. This prevents "I know so my character knows" bleed.
4. **Performance Reward:** Players who roleplay both characters convincingly (even pre-reveal) create richer paranoia for the table.

**Potential Concerns & Mitigations:**

| Concern | Mitigation |
|---------|------------|
| **"I'm confused—what do I do?"** | Emphasize: "Play both. Suspect everyone, including yourself." Give each sheet a simple goal: survive, find imposters. The ambiguity IS intentional. |
| **"How do I roleplay not knowing myself?"** | Lean into paranoia: "Why am I doubting my own memory? Did I really enter from this gate?" Imposter *detect thoughts* mimicry means even "you" might feel off. |
| **"What if triggers never happen?"** | Truth Bell (Round 5) is the failsafe. All unrevealed imposters get disclosed simultaneously. No player goes the full session without knowing. |
| **"Players might collude out-of-game."** | Social contract: Treat reveals as private until in-game actions expose them. Cheating ruins the fun for everyone—emphasize this in Session Zero. |
| **"Imposters might be too weak (CR 3 vs. Level 4+ PCs)."** | Doppelgangers get *Surprise Attack* (advantage + extra damage), environmental support (Spectral Hounds, fog), and player cunning. Balance via smart play, not raw stats. |
| **"Players attack each other recklessly."** | Friendly-fire mercy rules: contested saves, shout-interrupts, reduced damage. Punish recklessness via Crowd Favor loss (–2 Favor for attacking real ally without evidence). |
| **"Session drags if players overthink."** | Spectral Hounds and fog zones enforce pacing. Round 5 Truth Bell forces reveals. Keep combat moving; paranoia is spice, not the whole meal. |

**Improvements Over Original Design:**
- **Original:** Players knew their imposter from the start → obvious tells, GM burden high.
- **New:** Players uncertain until triggered → authentic paranoia, distributed GM load, emergent storytelling.
- **Result:** More immersive, less "DM vs. Players," heightened tension without unfair information asymmetry.

**When This Might Not Work:**
- Groups that dislike PvP or deception mechanics (Session Zero veto option).
- Players who struggle with ambiguity or need clear role definition (offer hybrid: reveal at Round 3 instead of event-based).
- Tables with trust issues or history of rules-lawyering (social contract breakdowns amplify).

## Announcer Beats
- Opening: "From five gates, five champions enter! But shadows wear their faces! Who is real? Who is false? **Kill the right ones, gladiators!**"
- First imposter revealed: "UNMASKED! The crowd gasps! But how many more lurk among you?!"
- Friendly fire incident: "Blood spills—ally or enemy? The sands care not! **Trust is a luxury!**"
- Fog activation: "The mists rise! Choke on doubt and poison alike!"
- Final imposter falls: "The last pretender crumbles! Truth stands bloodied but victorious! Tarsus roars!"

### Play Example (4-Player Session)

**Setup:**
- Alice plays: Real-Alice (Fighter) + Fake-Bob (Rogue imposter)
- Bob plays: Real-Bob (Rogue) + Fake-Carol (Cleric imposter)
- Carol plays: Real-Carol (Cleric) + Fake-Dan (Wizard imposter)
- Dan plays: Real-Dan (Wizard) + Fake-Alice (Fighter imposter)

**Round 1-2 (Pre-Reveal):**
- Alice controls both "Alice the Fighter" and "Bob the Rogue" simultaneously, not knowing which is the doppelganger.
- Alice (as Fighter): "I cautiously check the west corridor."
- Alice (as Rogue): "I stealth ahead to scout the meeting chamber."
- Bob (as Rogue): "I use my thieves' tools on the locked chest." (This is REAL Bob.)
- Bob (as Cleric): "I cast *bless* on nearby allies." (This is FAKE Carol, but Bob doesn't know yet.)
- Tension builds: Two "Bobs" exist in different locations, but only players notice the duplication.

**Round 3 (First Trigger):**
- Carol (as Cleric—the REAL one) casts *detect thoughts* on Bob (the Rogue).
- GM to Bob privately: "The Cleric senses your thoughts. You're real." *(Bob now knows Real-Bob is authentic; Fake-Carol is the imposter.)*
- Bob must continue playing both but now knows Fake-Carol's goal: sabotage and kill.
- Bob (as Fake-Carol) subtly suggests: "Maybe we should split up to cover more ground?" *(Isolating prey.)*

**Round 4 (Combat Trigger):**
- Dan (as Wizard) takes 15 damage from a Spectral Hound, dropping below half HP.
- GM to Dan privately: "As you bleed, you notice your wound shimmers wrong—too green. You're the imposter." *(Dan now knows Fake-Alice is HIM, and Real-Dan is authentic.)*
- Dan (as Fake-Alice, now revealed to himself): Begins positioning to backstab Real-Carol.

**Round 5 (Truth Bell):**
- Arena bell chimes. GM reveals remaining imposters to Alice and Carol privately.
- Alice learns she's controlling Fake-Bob (imposter).
- Carol learns she's controlling Fake-Dan (imposter).
- Now all players know their imposters but must continue performing both roles convincingly.

**Round 6-8 (Endgame):**
- Alice (as Fake-Bob) tries to isolate Real-Dan. Dan (as Real-Dan) successfully casts *fireball*, catching Fake-Bob in the blast.
- Carol (as Real-Carol) exposes Fake-Alice with *zone of truth*: "This 'Alice' doesn't remember our pact!" (+2 Favor for unmasking.)
- Finale: Real-Alice, Real-Bob, Real-Carol, Real-Dan survive. All four imposters eliminated. Victory, but trust is shattered.

### GM Prep Worksheet

**Step 1: Assign Identity Pairs (Circular Chain)**

| Player | Real PC | Imposter PC (they control) |
|--------|---------|----------------------------|
| Player A | [PC Name] from Gate [X] | [PC Name] from Gate [Y] |
| Player B | [PC Name] from Gate [Y] | [PC Name] from Gate [Z] |
| Player C | [PC Name] from Gate [Z] | [PC Name] from Gate [W] |
| Player D | [PC Name] from Gate [W] | [PC Name] from Gate [X] |

*Keep this chart PRIVATE. Players never see it.*

**Step 2: Prepare Character Sheets (Per Player)**

For each player, create two sheets formatted IDENTICALLY:

**Sheet Version A:**
```
CHARACTER: [PC Name 1]
CLASS/RACE: [Details]
ENTRY GATE: [Gate Letter]
GOAL: Survive and eliminate all imposters.
ABILITIES: [Full stat block / abbreviated version]
NOTES: [Any PC-specific details they'd know]
```

**Sheet Version B:**
```
CHARACTER: [PC Name 2]
CLASS/RACE: [Details]
ENTRY GATE: [Different Gate Letter]
GOAL: Survive and eliminate all imposters.
ABILITIES: [Full stat block / abbreviated for imposter OR real PC stats]
NOTES: [Any PC-specific details they'd know]
```

*On YOUR copy (not theirs), mark which is the imposter. Both sheets feel legitimate.*

**Step 3: Load Trigger Events**

Plan 5-6 trigger conditions (one per player + backup):

| Round | Trigger Type | Target Player | Reveal Method |
|-------|--------------|---------------|---------------|
| 2-3 | *Detect thoughts* / Insight success | [Player X] | Private note when magic succeeds |
| 3-4 | Combat damage (below 50% HP) | [Player Y] | Whisper: "Your blood looks wrong" |
| 4 | Signature ability attempt | [Player Z] | Confirm/deny privately based on truth |
| 5 | **Truth Bell (failsafe)** | All unrevealed | Simultaneous sealed notes to all |
| Flex | Environmental clue | [Player W] | "The mirror reflects you oddly" |

*Adjust timing based on table pacing.*

**Step 4: Revelation Delivery Method**

Choose ONE method and stick with it:
- **Index cards:** Pre-write "REAL" and "IMPOSTER" cards; hand them secretly when triggered.
- **Text/Discord DM:** Message player directly: "Your [Character Name] sheet is the imposter. Continue acting both roles."
- **Sealed envelopes:** Give each player an envelope labeled "Open when I signal"—hand signal triggers opening.

**Step 5: Session Zero Brief (Read to Players)**

> "Tonight, you each receive TWO character sheets. Both feel real. Both have the same goal: survive and eliminate imposters. You will NOT know which is real until the arena reveals it. Play both characters fully—alternate scenes, use different voices, roleplay both. External events (magic, combat, arena mechanics) will trigger revelations. Trust nothing. Suspect everyone—even yourself. The paranoia is the point."

## GM Tips

### Pre-Session Prep (Critical)
1. **Assign Identities Secretly:** Create a circular chain (e.g., Alice plays Real-Alice + Fake-Bob; Bob plays Real-Bob + Fake-Carol; Carol plays Real-Carol + Fake-Alice).
2. **Prepare Dual Sheets:** For each player, print TWO character sheets—both formatted identically with name, gate assignment, and "survive the imposters" goal. Mark YOUR copy privately with which is the doppelganger.
3. **Load Trigger Events:** Plan 4-6 trigger moments (magic checks, combat thresholds, Truth Bell, environmental cues). Ensure every player gets revealed by Round 5.
4. **Prepare Private Reveal Method:** Use index cards, text messages, or Discord DMs—never verbal in front of the group.

### Running the Session
- **Open with Ambiguity:** "You all have two sheets. You're not sure which is real. Play both. Trust nothing." Let paranoia marinate.
- **Track Triggers Carefully:** When a trigger condition is met (Insight success, *detect thoughts*, HP threshold), immediately reveal to that player privately which sheet is the imposter.
- **Encourage Split Focus:** Players should alternate scenes between their two characters naturally ("I check the east corridor as Theron; meanwhile, my Kira moves toward the meeting chamber").
- **Reward Clever Detection:** If a player deduces their own imposter before a trigger, confirm it privately—but don't reveal others' statuses.
- **Behavioral Cues (Post-Reveal):** Once a player knows their imposter, watch for subtle shifts—they should continue "performing" both roles but the imposter may start isolating targets or feeding misinformation.
- **Friendly Fire Mercy:** Allow contested rolls (Dex save, opposed Persuasion) to interrupt PC-vs-PC attacks: "I shout 'WAIT!' and grab their sword arm!"
- **Spectral Hounds as Pressure:** Use these to force grouping; players can't hide solo indefinitely without risking hound attacks.
- **Truth Bell Failsafe (Round 5):** If anyone hasn't been revealed yet, the arena's bell chimes and you reveal ALL remaining imposters simultaneously via private notes. This prevents endless uncertainty.

### Handling Edge Cases
- **Player Asks "Which sheet is mine?":** Smile mysteriously. Say nothing. The uncertainty IS the game.
- **Player Attacks Their Own Imposter:** Allow it if they've deduced it in-character; this is clever play. Award bonus Favor for self-awareness.
- **Imposter Revealed Too Early (Round 1-2):** That's okay! The player now gets to enjoy a longer "performance" phase. Other players remain uncertain about their own sheets.
- **Player Paralyzed by Uncertainty:** Whisper: "Play both fully. The truth will come." If they're truly stuck, accelerate their trigger privately.
- **Magic Spam (*detect thoughts* on everyone):** Impose costs—concentration, enemy reactions, or Spectral Hounds attacking the caster during their distraction. Balance detective work vs. survival.

## Aftermath Seeds
- **Patron Interest:** Espionage master impressed by paranoia management; offers infiltration contract or information network access.
- **Rumor:** Doppelgangers were planted by a rival arena faction to destabilize Tarsus gladiators; conspiracy brewing.
- **Downtime:** PC who killed an imposter of themselves gains haunting dreams (disadvantage on Wisdom saves for 1d4 days; can be removed via *lesser restoration* or therapy).
- **Injury:** PC who suffered friendly fire damage develops trust issues (disadvantage on Insight checks vs. allies for 1 session).
- **Political:** Crowd debates which PC showed best judgment under deception; patron offers private mentorship to "the clever one."
- **Loot:** Doppelganger corpses yield **Mimicry Dust** (consume to gain advantage on Deception checks to impersonate someone for 1 hour; 1d3 doses, 25 gp each).
