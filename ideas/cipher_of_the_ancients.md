# Cipher of the Ancients

- **Hook:** The arena floor bears ancient runes—fragments of a forgotten tongue that promise power to those who can read them. Scattered across the battlefield are stone tablets, each bearing a piece of the cipher. Decode the message before time runs out, or face the wrath of the guardians awakened by your ignorance.
- **Party:** 4-6 PCs, level 5+. Emphasize Intelligence checks, teamwork under pressure, and balancing combat with puzzle-solving.

## Arena Layout
- Circular arena (150 feet diameter) with **6 Runic Tablets** positioned around the perimeter (evenly spaced, 25 feet from center).
- **Central Obelisk** (20 feet tall, carved stone) at the arena's heart—the final answer must be spoken here.
- Terrain: scattered rubble (difficult terrain), shallow channels of glowing liquid (harmless, but obscure vision), stone platforms (5 feet high, provide vantage points).
- **Ancient Glyphs** etched into the floor—decorative but hint at the cipher's structure.
- Crowd watches from tiered seating; scrying crystals project tablet inscriptions to spectators.

## Core Mechanic: Decoding the Cipher
The arena contains **6 Runic Tablets**, each bearing an encrypted word. Collectively, they form a six-word command phrase in an ancient language.

### Tablet Discovery
- Each tablet is a **stone slab** (5x3 feet, carved with glowing runes).
- PCs must physically reach each tablet and spend **1 action** to study it.
- Upon study, DM reveals the **encrypted word** (use simple substitution cipher: A=Z, B=Y, C=X, etc., or symbolic cipher with provided key).

### Cipher Key
- One tablet (randomly determined) contains the **Cipher Key**—a legend showing symbol-to-letter mappings.
- Without the key, decryption is **very hard** (Intelligence DC 20 per word, takes 1 minute per attempt).
- With the key, decryption is **moderate** (Intelligence DC 14 per word, takes 1 action).
- PCs can work together (Help action grants advantage).

### Command Phrase
Once all six words are decoded, they form a command phrase in the ancient tongue (e.g., "STONE SLEEP IRON WAKE GUARDIAN KNEEL").

### Activating the Obelisk
- A PC must stand adjacent to the Central Obelisk and **speak the command phrase aloud** (bonus action or action).
- **Correct Phrase:** Guardians deactivate; arena gates open; victory achieved.
- **Incorrect Phrase:** Guardians enrage (+2 to attack rolls and damage for 3 rounds); attempt can be retried but wastes precious time.
- **No Phrase by Round 15:** Arena floor begins to **collapse** (see Hazards).

## Enemies (Ancient Guardians)
Stone constructs that awaken when PCs approach tablets. They **protect the cipher** but don't actively pursue; they defend tablet zones.

### 4 PCs
- 3 **Rune Sentinels** (use Animated Armor, CR 1; stationed near tablets; attack PCs who linger too long).
- 1 **Stone Guardian** (use Stone Golem, CR 10, reduced HP to 100; patrols arena center; punishes PCs who approach obelisk prematurely).

### 5 PCs
- 4 Rune Sentinels.
- 1 Stone Guardian (CR 10, HP 120).
- Add 2 **Glyph Wraiths** (use Specter, CR 1; phase through rubble; drain energy from PCs attempting decryption).

### 6 PCs
- 5 Rune Sentinels.
- 1 Stone Guardian (CR 10, HP 140).
- 3 Glyph Wraiths.
- Add 1 **Cipher Sphinx** (use Gynosphinx, CR 11, reduced HP to 100; asks riddles before allowing tablet access; wrong answer = psychic damage).

### Enemy Tactics
- **Rune Sentinels** defend tablets; stand motionless until a PC approaches within 10 feet, then activate and attack.
- **Stone Guardian** patrols the Central Obelisk; attacks anyone who approaches without speaking the correct phrase first.
- **Glyph Wraiths** (if present) drain life from PCs studying tablets (Life Drain attack interrupts concentration on decryption).
- **Cipher Sphinx** (if present) perches on a platform; asks **one riddle** before allowing access to a tablet (Riddle DC 15 Intelligence check; failure = 3d8 psychic damage).

## Objectives
- **Primary:** Decode all six encrypted words from the Runic Tablets.
- **Secondary:** Speak the correct command phrase at the Central Obelisk before Round 15.
- **Tertiary:** Survive the Ancient Guardians while solving the puzzle (bonus Favor for minimal casualties).

## Tactical Elements
- **Divide and Conquer:** PCs must split up to reach all six tablets quickly (but risk being isolated against guardians).
- **Decryption Cooperation:** PCs can share discovered words and collaborate on decoding (Help action, message spells, hand signals).
- **Tablet Defense:** Rune Sentinels activate when approached; PCs must fight while studying (risky but necessary).
- **Key Priority:** Finding the Cipher Key tablet first dramatically speeds decryption; PCs may need to scout or guess which tablet holds it.
- **Time Pressure:** 15-round timer forces urgency; every round spent fighting is a round not spent decoding.
- **Obelisk Guardian:** Stone Guardian punishes premature obelisk approaches; PCs must decode *before* attempting the command.

## Hazards and Twists
- **Glowing Channels:** Harmless liquid flows through channels (obscures floor runes; disadvantage on Investigation checks to spot hidden clues).
- **Collapsing Floor (Round 15+):** If command phrase not spoken by Round 15, arena floor begins crumbling. Each round, 1d4 random 10x10 sections collapse (Dex save DC 15 or fall 20 feet into darkness; 2d6 bludgeoning damage; climbing out requires Athletics DC 14).
- **False Tablets:** 1-2 tablets contain **decoy symbols** that look like cipher text but are meaningless (Insight DC 13 to recognize as fake; studying a fake tablet wastes time).
- **Glyph Trap:** When a PC studies a tablet, they may trigger a **Glyph of Warding** (Wisdom save DC 14 or 3d8 lightning damage; half on success; glyph appears on 1-2 tablets, randomly).
- **Round 10 Twist:** Stone Guardian **speaks** (deep, booming voice): "Speak the truth or be dust!" (psychological pressure; no mechanical effect but heightens tension).
- **Riddle Sphinx (if present):** Asks riddles tied to campaign lore or general knowledge (e.g., "I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. What am I?" Answer: Echo). Wrong answer = psychic damage.

## Crowd Favor Hooks
- First PC to discover a Runic Tablet: +1 [[crowds_favor|Favor]].
- Successfully decode a word on first attempt (no retries): +1 Favor per word.
- Find the Cipher Key tablet: +2 Favor for cleverness.
- Defeat a Rune Sentinel while simultaneously decoding a tablet: +2 Favor for multitasking.
- Answer the Cipher Sphinx's riddle correctly (if present): +2 Favor for wit.
- Speak the correct command phrase at the obelisk: +3 Favor.
- Complete the puzzle before Round 12: +2 Favor for speed.
- Share decoded words with allies using [[panache|Panache]] (creative signal, spell, or shout): +1 Favor.

## Announcer Beats
- Opening: "The runes AWAKEN! Ancient secrets lie scattered! **Can they read what was written in stone?!**"
- First tablet discovered: "They've found the first fragment! But can they READ it?!"
- Cipher Key found: "The KEY! They have the key to the cipher! Now the race begins!"
- Rune Sentinel activates: "STONE LIVES! The guardians RISE! Protect the tablets or pay the price!"
- First word decoded: "SUCCESS! They decode the first word! Five remain!"
- Wrong phrase spoken at obelisk: "NO! The guardians RAGE! Wrong answer, gladiators! TRY AGAIN!"
- Round 10 warning: "The floor TREMBLES! Time runs short! Decode or DIE!"
- Correct phrase spoken: "THE ANCIENTS ANSWER! The guardians KNEEL! Stone bows to mind! **Tarsus roars for the scholars victorious!**"

## GM Tips
- **Pre-Prep Cipher:** Create six simple encrypted words using substitution cipher or symbolic key (e.g., "STONE SLEEP IRON WAKE GUARDIAN KNEEL"). Provide Cipher Key on one tablet.
- **Visual Aids:** Use handouts for tablet inscriptions (show encrypted symbols). Provide physical Cipher Key card or reveal it verbally.
- **Time Tracking:** Track rounds visibly (countdown timer, initiative tracker). Announce "Round X of 15" each round to maintain tension.
- **Tablet Proximity:** Rune Sentinels activate when PCs approach within 10 feet; describe them as "stone armor suddenly shifting to life—eyes glowing red."
- **Decryption Pacing:** Allow Help action for decryption (multiple PCs can collaborate). Don't make cipher *too* hard—moderate challenge that rewards teamwork.
- **Stone Guardian Threat:** Make it clear the obelisk is guarded; describe Stone Guardian as "immovable, implacable, waiting." Don't surprise-TPK PCs who approach early.
- **Collapsing Floor Drama:** When floor starts collapsing, describe it vividly—"Cracks spider across stone; chunks tumble into darkness; the arena itself is DYING."
- **Sphinx Riddles (if present):** Prepare 3-4 riddles in advance (classic riddles or campaign-specific). Make them solvable but not trivial.
- **Incorrect Phrase:** If PCs speak wrong phrase, Stone Guardian **roars** and attacks with fury (+2 bonus); describe guardians glowing brighter, moving faster.

## Aftermath Seeds
- **Patron Interest:** Sage's Guild impressed by decryption skills; offers contract to translate ancient texts or decode rival's encrypted messages.
- **Rumor:** The command phrase was actually a **summoning spell**—somewhere in the world, something ancient has awakened (leads to side quest).
- **Downtime:** PC who decoded the most words gains **Runic Insight** (advantage on Investigation checks involving ancient languages for 1 week).
- **Injury:** PC who failed decryption attempts multiple times suffers **Mental Fatigue** (disadvantage on Intelligence checks for 1d4 days; removable via *lesser restoration*).
- **Political:** Crowd debates whether brains or brawn matter more in the arena ("They won with WORDS!" vs. "They still had to fight!"). Intellectual patrons take notice.
- **Loot:** Cipher Key tablet (if retrieved) functions as **Rosetta Stone** (grants advantage on Intelligence checks to decode languages; 300 gp value; fragile—shatters if dropped in combat).
- **Secret:** One of the tablets contains a **hidden message** visible only under moonlight (leads to secret treasure cache beneath the arena or reveals location of ancient artifact).
