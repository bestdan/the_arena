# Iron Colossus Prime

- **Hook:** Gnomish artificers unveil their masterwork—a war-golem prototype powered by elemental cores. The arena becomes testing ground. Dismantle the machine before it dismantles you.
- **Party:** 4-6 PCs, level 8-10. Tactical weak-point destruction, construct immunities, and modular combat.

## Arena Layout
- Industrial proving grounds (100-foot square)—metal floor with gear-track rails (10-foot wide paths) that Colossus uses for rapid repositioning.
- Four elemental cores (floating orbs at corners: Fire, Ice, Lightning, Acid)—Colossus draws power from them (bonus action, ranged 60 feet); destroying core (AC 14, 30 HP, vulnerable to opposing element) removes associated ability.
- Hydraulic pistons (initiative 20): random 20-foot section of floor compresses or rises; Dex save DC 14 or take 2d8 bludgeoning and knocked prone.
- Steam vents (8 scattered): provide half-cover but burst with superheated steam when Colossus steps adjacent (2d6 fire, 10-foot radius, Dex DC 13 half).

## Enemies (mechanical monstrosity plus swarm drones)
- 1 **Iron Colossus** (reskin Iron Golem with modifications, CR 16 reduced to CR 12 by modular design):
  - **Core Abilities (starts with all 4):**
    - Fire Core: Breath weapon (30-foot cone, 6d6 fire, Dex DC 15 half, recharge 5-6).
    - Ice Core: Frost aura (10-foot radius, creatures start turn take 2d6 cold and -10 movement).
    - Lightning Core: Chain lightning strike (60 feet, 4d10 lightning to primary target, jumps to 2 others within 15 feet, Dex DC 15 half).
    - Acid Core: Corroding slash (melee attack deals additional 3d6 acid and reduces AC by 1 until repaired).
  - Loses abilities when corresponding cores destroyed.
- 6 **Animated Armor Drones** (CR 1)—swarm tactics, repair Colossus (action, heal 2d8+4) if left unchecked.
- 2 **Gnome Artificer Operators** (use Mage stats with *catapult*, *heat metal*, *haste* prepared)—hide in observation platforms (15 feet up), buff Colossus.
- **Flex:** For 4 PCs, Colossus starts with 2 cores destroyed (GM chooses which 2 remain); 4 Animated Armor, 1 Artificer. For 6 PCs, add 4 **Flying Sword Drones** (CR 1/4) and third Artificer with *counterspell*.

## Colossus Tactical Modes
- **Opening (All Cores Active):** Overwhelming power—uses all four core abilities in rotation. Armor Drones screen and repair.
- **Mid-Fight (2-3 Cores Remain):** Tactical adaptation—focuses remaining abilities on priority targets. Uses gear-rails to reposition to protect remaining cores.
- **Bloodied (half HP):** Emergency protocols—Artificers cast *haste* on Colossus (2 attacks per turn). Colossus targets cores' destroyers with revenge strikes.
- **Critical (25% HP):** Self-destruct sequence announced (5 rounds)—Colossus goes berserk, attacks recklessly. If reaches 0 HP before timer, explodes (30-foot radius, 8d6 fire, Dex DC 16 half).

## Crowd Favor Hooks
- Destroying first elemental core: +2 Favor to destroyer.
- Destroying all four cores (disabling all abilities): +4 Favor (party-wide, "surgical dismantling!").
- Preventing Animated Armor from healing Colossus: +1 Favor per prevention.
- Surviving self-destruct explosion at point-blank range (within 5 feet of Colossus when timer hits zero): +3 Favor.
- Using [[panache_mechanics]] to climb Colossus and attack core from atop it: +3 Favor on success (Athletics DC 16 to climb, advantage on core attacks while mounted).

## Hazards and Tactical Opportunities
- **Gear-rails:** Colossus can spend movement to "ride" rail to opposite side of arena (60-foot rapid transit). PCs can sabotage rails (Thieves' Tools DC 15) to cause crash (4d6 bludgeoning to Colossus, prone).
- **Elemental cores:** Vulnerable to opposing elements (fire vs ice, lightning vs acid). Smart PCs can redirect Colossus's own breath weapon to destroy cores.
- **Hydraulic pistons:** Can be triggered manually (Mechanics check DC 14) to crush Colossus (6d8 bludgeoning if caught).
- **Steam vents:** Colossus immune to fire but PCs can use vents as area-denial or damage sources.

## Announcer Beats
- Opening: "BEHOLD—IRON COLOSSUS PRIME! The future of warfare! Can flesh and blood triumph over STEEL AND SCIENCE?"
- First core destroyed: "A CORE FALLS! The machine weakens—PRESS THE ADVANTAGE!"
- Self-destruct announced: "FIVE ROUNDS! THE COLOSSUS WILL EXPLODE! FINISH IT OR RUN!"
- Colossus dismantled (all cores gone): "POWERLESS! The once-mighty golem stands DEFENSELESS—end this!"
- Finale: "SCRAP METAL! Innovation bows to determination!" (victory) or "DETONATION! The arena BURNS!" (defeat, arena heavily damaged).

## GM Tips
- Telegraph core vulnerabilities early—Artificers shout warnings ("Protect the Fire Core!") or PCs with Arcana checks (DC 14) identify weaknesses.
- Self-destruct timer creates urgency—count down each round aloud for tension.
- Let martials shine—construct immunities (poison, psychic, charm) favor weapon-users.
- Animated Armor repairs are clutch threat—PCs must decide between damaging Colossus or stopping heals.
- Use [[last_stand]] against self-destruct—one PC stays to finish Colossus while others flee, dies in explosion but saves arena.
- Gnome Artificers can be negotiated with if Colossus near defeat ("Shut it down and we spare you!").

## Aftermath Seeds
- Victory: Salvage elemental cores (magic items: *Elemental Gem* variants—can summon elemental 1/day).
- Loot: Colossus chassis parts—*+1 Adamantine Plate Armor*, *Mechanical Gauntlets* (+2 Strength, max 22), or *Golem Heart* (rare spell component).
- Defeat: Colossus escapes arena, rampages through Tarsus; military mobilizes (PCs must help stop or city suffers).
- Artificer reaction: If spared, offer to craft custom magic items for PCs (at cost) or hire PCs as "field testers" for next prototype.
- Gnomish guild politics: Success impresses guild; failure angers them—future artificer encounters friendly or hostile based on outcome.
- Arena upgrade: If Colossus salvaged, arena installs mechanical hazards in future sessions (gear-rails, pistons become permanent fixtures).
