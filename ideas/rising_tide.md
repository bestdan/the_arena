# Rising Tide

- **Hook:** "Will they drown or dominate?" The arena floor is a sunken pit filling with water from beneath. Stone pillars of varying heights offer temporary refuge, but the water rises relentlessly. Gladiators must fight while climbing upward, balancing on narrow platforms, or swimming through monster-infested depths.
- **Party:** 4-6 PCs, level 6+. Tests vertical mobility, swimming ability, and resource management as safe ground disappears.

## Arena Layout
- Circular sunken pit (120-foot diameter, 40 feet deep below spectator level).
- **Stone Pillars:** 12 pillars of varying heights (10-40 feet tall, 5-foot diameter tops) scattered across pit.
  - **Low Pillars** (10 feet): Submerged by round 4.
  - **Mid Pillars** (25 feet): Submerged by round 8.
  - **High Pillars** (40 feet): Never submerged, but cramped (1-2 Medium creatures can stand safely).
- **Water Entry:** Grates in pit floor release water; starts at ground level, rises 5 feet per round at initiative count 20.
- **Chains:** Hanging chains connect some pillars (Athletics DC 12 to swing between pillars, DC 14 to climb while wet).

## Rising Water Mechanic
- **Water Level:** Starts at 0 feet, rises 5 feet per round.
  - **Round 1-2:** Ankle-deep (difficult terrain).
  - **Round 3-4:** Chest-deep (swim speed required to move efficiently, non-swimmers at half speed).
  - **Round 5-8:** Fully submerged (swimming required, no ground to stand on except pillar tops).
  - **Round 9-12:** Water reaches mid-height pillars (only high pillars remain).
  - **Round 13+:** Water rises to spectator level (PCs must escape or swim indefinitely).

## Swimming and Drowning Rules
- **Swimming:** Creatures without swim speed move at half speed while swimming; Athletics check DC 10 to move full speed for 1 round (or maintain position in current).
- **Holding Breath:** Creatures can hold breath for 1 + Constitution modifier minutes (minimum 30 seconds).
- **Drowning:** When a creature runs out of breath, it drops to 0 HP and is dying. Standard death saves apply.
- **Exhaustion from Swimming:** After 10 rounds of continuous swimming, Constitution save DC 12 (increases by 2 each check) or gain 1 level exhaustion.

## Enemies (aquatic predators)
- 2 Hunter Sharks (CR 2 each; blood frenzy when PCs are injured, superior swim speed, pack tactics).
- 3 Merrow (CR 2 each; amphibious, harpoon attacks pull PCs underwater, grapple and drown tactics).
- 2 Water Elementals (CR 5 each; whelm ability engulfs and drowns PCs, move through water freely).
- 1 Sea Hag (CR 2; horrific appearance causes fright, illusory appearance tricks PCs, death glare).
- 1 Giant Octopus (CR 1; tentacle grapples, ink cloud for concealment, climbs pillars).
- **Flex:** For 4 PCs, remove 1 Merrow and 1 Hunter Shark. For 6 PCs, add 1 more Water Elemental and upgrade Sea Hag to a Coven member with spells.

## Enemy Tactics
- **Hunter Sharks:** Attack injured PCs with blood frenzy; drag victims deeper underwater.
- **Merrow:** Harpoon PCs on pillars, pull them into water, then grapple and hold underwater to drown.
- **Water Elementals:** Use whelm to engulf PCs (suffocate inside elemental); move through water to attack from any angle.
- **Sea Hag:** Stays hidden until water is deep enough; death glare on isolated PCs, horrific appearance scares PCs off pillars.
- **Giant Octopus:** Climbs pillars to grapple PCs, drags them underwater with tentacles, uses ink cloud to blind and escape.

## Crowd Favor Hooks
- Climb to highest pillar and make ranged/spell attacks on aquatic enemies below: +1 [[crowds_favor_mechanic|Favor]] for tactical superiority.
- Defeat an enemy while fully submerged (both underwater): +2 Favor for drowning the drowner.
- Swing on a chain between pillars while attacking mid-swing: +2 Favor for acrobatic spectacle.
- Rescue a drowning ally (bring them to air/pillar before death save failure): +2 Favor for heroic rescue.
- Never get wet (stay on pillars entire fight): +3 Favor for perfect positioning.
- Kill a Water Elemental using lightning damage (vulnerability): +2 Favor for exploiting weakness.
- Use the water creatively (create whirlpool with spell, freeze surface, part water, etc.): +2 Favor for environmental mastery.

## Hazards and Environment
- **Rising Water:** Constant pressure to climb higher; ground-based PCs forced to adapt.
- **Drowning Risk:** Being grappled underwater = death sentence without rescue.
- **Pillar Crowding:** High pillars fit 1-2 creatures; forced proximity creates tactical problems.
- **Slippery Surfaces:** Wet pillars and chains harder to grip (Athletics checks at disadvantage when wet).
- **Underwater Combat:** Attacks with non-piercing weapons at disadvantage underwater; spells requiring verbal components can't be cast while submerged.
- **Visibility:** Water becomes murky with blood and combat debris (lightly obscured after round 6).

## Announcer Beats
- Opening: "THE TIDE RISES! Stone pillars your only refuge! Will they climb—or DROWN?!"
- Water rising: "Five feet higher! The water hungers! Climb, gladiators, CLIMB!"
- First drowning risk: "Dragged beneath! Bubbles rise! Can they break free?!"
- Enemy underwater kill: "BLOOD IN THE WATER! The shark thrashes—and DIES! Impossible!"
- Heroic rescue: "He dives! He grabs her! They surface together—ALIVE!"
- Desperate scramble: "Only the highest pillars remain! They cling like shipwreck survivors!"
- Victory: "They stand above the flood! The waters recede! Tarsus salutes its swimmers!"

## GM Tips
- Track water level visibly (dice tower, water line on map, or verbal announcements each round).
- Remind PCs of swim speed and breath-holding rules before combat starts (teaching moment).
- Narrate water rising viscerally: "Water laps at your knees," "You feel the pull of the current."
- Enemies should exploit environment—Merrow pull PCs down, Sharks attack swimmers, Elementals engulf.
- Give PCs with swim speed (Tritons, water genasi, Druid wild shape) spotlight moments.
- If PC drowns, make it dramatic but fair—allies can still save them with healing or pulling to surface.
- Let creative spells shine: *water walk*, *shape water*, *control water*, *create/destroy water*.
- Consider environmental storytelling: dead bodies from previous matches float up as water rises (macabre).

## Aftermath Seeds
- Patron interest: Merchant navy captain impressed by "aquatic combat"; offers naval escort contract (sea monsters, pirates).
- Rumor: The water source is a subterranean spring connected to ancient drowned city—treasures and curses below.
- Downtime: Merrow harpoon can be harvested (crafted into barbed spear with bleed damage, weaponsmith required, 75 gp cost).
- Injury: PC who nearly drowned develops "Hydrophobia"—disadvantage on saves vs. drowning, fear of deep water (roleplaying).
- Political: Arena engineers investigated for water release timing—sabotage accusations fly (rival arena? Cult?).
- Reward: Sea Hag's coral crown (can be sold for 200 gp or worn for *water breathing* 1/day, cursed with nightmares).
