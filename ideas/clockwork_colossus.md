# Blades of the Clockwork Colossus

- **Hook:** Artificer guild sponsors a "precision execution"; gears feed the crowd's countdown.
- **Arena Layout:** Central clockwork statue with three rotating ring-blades moving one zone clockwise each round. Four gear-pillars can be jammed (Athletics/Thieves' Tools) to slow or redirect blades. Sparks ignite oil slicks near cover.

## Encounter (4-6 PCs, mid-tier low level)
- 1 Shield Guardian or reskinned Helmed Horror as the Colossus.
- 2 Gnome Artificers (use Mage with lightning flavor) hiding behind gear-pillars.
- 3 Animated Armors guarding the pillars.
- **Flex:** For 4 PCs, remove 1 Artificer and 1 Animated Armor. For 6 PCs, add 2 Flying Swords circling the outer ring.
