# The Floor is Lava

## Hook
The arena floor is made of pressure-sensitive tiles. Step on one for too long, and it heats up. Stay longer, and it ERUPTS. The gladiators must keep moving while fighting, or burn. But the enemies? They're fire-resistant, and they want to corner you.

## Tile Mechanics

### Heat Stages
Each 5 ft tile tracks heat based on how long someone stands on it:
- **Cold** (grey): Safe, no effect
- **Warm** (orange): Stood on 1 round—no damage yet, but glowing
- **Hot** (red): Stood on 2 rounds—1d6 fire damage at end of turn
- **Eruption** (white): Stood on 3+ rounds—2d6 fire damage, erupts into 10 ft column (blocks movement for 1 round)

### Cooling
- A tile cools 1 stage per round with no one on it
- Water creates (thrown waterskin, Create Water spell) = instant cool to Cold
- 3 **Cooling Vents** on the arena (action to activate, 15 ft radius cools to Cold)

### Movement Pressure
- Moving at least 20 ft on your turn = all tiles you touched stay Cold
- Ending your turn where you started = that tile heats by 2 stages instantly
- Enemies will try to block corridors, forcing you to stop or backtrack

## Arena Layout
- 60 x 60 ft grid of tiles (144 tiles total—don't track all, just occupied ones)
- **3 Cooling Vents** (northwest, center, southeast)—activation refreshes area
- **4 Stone Pillars** (corners)—don't heat, safe to stand on, but only 5 ft each
- **Raised Platform** (center)—10 ft diameter, metal—heats SLOWER (double rounds to stage up)
- **Lava Channels** (already permanent lava, 10 ft wide)—split arena into 4 quadrants, must jump/climb to cross

## Enemies
- **2 Magma Mephits** (CR 1/2)—fly (ignore tiles), immune to fire, taunt PCs into staying still
- **1 Fire Elemental** (CR 5, weakened: 75 HP, damage reduced by half)—slow but terrifying, every tile it touches becomes Hot instantly
- **2 Ash Goblins** (reskinned Goblins with fire resistance)—throw hot coals (1d4 fire, 30 ft range), try to block chokepoints

### Fire Elemental Tactics
- Slow (20 ft speed)—players can outrun it
- Leaves a "heat trail"—every tile it crosses goes to Warm
- Wants to corner PCs against lava channels

## Crowd's Favor Opportunities
- Jump a lava channel dramatically: Panache roll (DC 10 Athletics to clear 10 ft)
- Push an enemy onto Hot tile: +1 Favor
- Stand on Cold tile surrounded by Hot tiles (showoff): Panache roll
- Sacrifice movement to save ally from Eruption: +2 Favor
- Use Cooling Vent at last possible second before Eruption: Panache roll + 1 Favor

## Scaling
- **3 PCs**: 1 Magma Mephit, Fire Elemental has 50 HP, 1 Ash Goblin
- **5 PCs**: 3 Magma Mephits, Fire Elemental at full 75 HP, 3 Ash Goblins

## Environmental Hazards (Beyond Tiles)
- **Steam Vents**: 3 random tiles per round belch steam—1d4 fire damage, no save, marks the tile
- **Collapsing Tiles**: After 5 Eruptions total, random Cold tiles collapse into pits (DC 12 Dex or fall 10 ft)
- **Heat Shimmer**: Center of arena = disadvantage on ranged attacks (distorted vision)

## Announcer Beats
- "The FLOOR betrays the still! KEEP MOVING, gladiators!"
- First Eruption: "ERUPTION! The floor SPITS fire! Did you forget the rules?"
- Fire Elemental enters: "The ELEMENTAL hungers! Every step it takes, the ground SEETHES!"
- PC takes damage from tile: "BURNING! They stood too long! The crowd WINCES!"
- PC jumps lava channel: "BEAUTIFUL! Across the river of fire like a BIRD!"

## GM Tips
- Only track tiles that PCs/enemies are on or recently left—don't map everything
- Use colored markers: grey (cold), orange (warm), red (hot)
- Keep combat moving fast—3-4 rounds should feel frantic
- Fire Elemental is a ZONE of danger, not a priority target—players should avoid, not fight directly

## Aftermath Seeds
- Magma Mephit cores worth 30 gp—used in fire resistance crafting
- Fire Elemental's "heart" (if killed) can be harvested—legendary crafting component
- Cooling Vent mechanism can be studied—downtime project for magical cooling items
- "The Floor is Lava" becomes a crowd favorite game—optional future mechanic for exhibition matches
