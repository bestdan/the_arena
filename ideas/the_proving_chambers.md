# The Proving Chambers

- **Hook:** The arena transforms into a labyrinth of locked chambers. PCs awaken in the central hub with no memory of entry—four doors beckon, each marked with cryptic symbols. Only one leads to freedom; the others to doom. Solve the riddles, prove your worth, or perish in the attempt. The crowd wagers on which door they'll choose first.
- **Party:** 4-6 PCs, level 4+. Emphasize problem-solving, investigation, and handling multiple puzzle tracks simultaneously.

## Arena Layout

- **Central Hub** (40-foot diameter circular chamber)—PCs start here; ceiling is 20 feet high with scrying orbs watching from above.
- **Four Doors** positioned at cardinal directions (North, East, South, West), each 10 feet tall, solid iron with glowing runes.
- Each door leads to a **Challenge Chamber** (30x30 feet) with unique puzzle and guardian.
- **Exit Portal** appears in the Central Hub only after the **correct door's challenge** is completed.
- **False Doors** trigger trap sequences when their challenges are completed incorrectly.

### Door Markings (Clues in Central Hub)

Each door bears a symbol and cryptic verse etched in Common:

- **North Door (Serpent Symbol):** *"Wisdom coils in silence deep, fangs reveal what others keep."*
- **East Door (Flame Symbol):** *"Passion burns but cannot last, ashes speak of futures past."*
- **South Door (Crown Symbol):** *"Authority demands the knee, but freedom's price is mutiny."* (**Correct Door**)
- **West Door (Scale Symbol):** *"Balance bends to stronger hand, truth is weight you understand."*

### Central Hub Features

- Stone pedestal in the center with four colored gemstones matching the doors (red for North/Serpent, orange for East/Flame, green for South/Crown, silver for West/Scale)—**clue mechanism** (see below).
- Floor tiles form a circular pattern with symbols matching the four doors.
- Scrying orbs above broadcast to the crowd (PCs see faint reflections of crowd reactions).
- **Time Pressure:** Every 3 rounds, the hub's walls contract 5 feet inward (starts at 40-foot diameter: Round 3=35ft, Round 6=30ft, Round 9=25ft, Round 12=20ft). At the start of Round 13, the chamber becomes too cramped for safety (all creatures take 10d10 bludgeoning damage, Dex save DC 18 for half) and continues crushing each round thereafter.

## Gemstone Clue System

The central pedestal has four gemstones. When a PC touches a gemstone and succeeds on an Arcana check (DC 12), it projects a vision:

- **Red Gem (North/Serpent):** Vision shows a serpent devouring its tail—endless cycle, no escape.
- **Orange Gem (East/Flame):** Vision shows a fire consuming a map—knowledge destroyed.
- **Green Gem (South/Crown):** Vision shows a crown shattered by a hammer—freedom through defiance. (**Correct hint**)
- **Silver Gem (West/Scale):** Vision shows scales tipping toward a dark void—balance lost to chaos.

**Insight DC 14** after seeing all four visions reveals the pattern: the South Door (Crown/mutiny) represents breaking free from imposed authority—the only path to true escape.

## Challenge Chambers

PCs can attempt chambers in any order. Each chamber locks behind them when entered (door seals for 5 rounds or until challenge is resolved).

### North Chamber (Serpent's Wisdom) - **FALSE PATH**

**Puzzle:** Room contains seven stone serpent statues arranged in a circle. Each serpent's mouth is open, revealing a hollow interior. A riddle is inscribed on the floor:

*"Seven speak lies, but one tells truth. Find the honest serpent's tooth."*

**Solution:** PCs must use *detect magic*, *zone of truth*, or Investigation (DC 16) to identify the truthful serpent (it's the one facing **away** from the center). Placing a gemstone or valuable in its mouth opens a hidden compartment with a **silver key**.

**Twist:** The key doesn't open the exit—it activates a trap. Using it in the Central Hub summons 2 **Basilisks** (CR 3) that attack the party for 3 rounds before turning to stone.

**Guardian:** 1 **Yuan-ti Pureblood** (CR 1) hiding in shadows; attacks if PCs linger more than 4 rounds. Uses suggestion to mislead PCs toward the wrong serpent.

### East Chamber (Flame's Memory) - **FALSE PATH**

**Puzzle:** Room is filled with braziers and a large stone tablet covered in scorch marks. The tablet reads:

*"Burn away the lies to see the truth beneath."*

**Solution:** PCs must use fire (torch, spell, etc.) to heat the tablet, revealing hidden ink messages. The messages tell a story of a gladiator who tried to escape via the East Door and perished. Investigation DC 14 reveals burn marks on the floor shaped like a warning symbol.

**Twist:** Completing this puzzle causes the braziers to erupt. All creatures in the room take 3d6 fire damage (Dex save DC 14 for half). A **fire elemental** (CR 5, reduced HP to 60) emerges and attacks for 2 rounds before dissipating.

**Guardian:** 1 **Azer** (CR 2) tending the braziers; non-hostile unless PCs attack first. Can be convinced (Persuasion DC 15) to warn that "the East Door burns all who choose it."

### South Chamber (Crown's Rebellion) - **CORRECT PATH**

**Puzzle:** Room contains a stone throne with a crown resting on it. Chains hang from the walls, and manacles litter the floor. An inscription on the throne reads:

*"Kings claim thrones, but slaves take freedom. Break the crown to break your chains."*

**Solution:** PCs must **destroy the crown** (AC 12, 20 HP) rather than wear it or place it elsewhere. Doing so causes the throne to sink into the floor, revealing a glowing **exit rune** beneath.

**Twist:** If a PC wears the crown, they are dominated (Wisdom save DC 15) and compelled to attack their allies for 3 rounds. The crown can be removed with a successful grapple check or *remove curse*.

**Guardian:** 1 **Chain Devil** (CR 8, reduced HP to 80; **Flex**: CR 6 for 4 PCs) bound to the throne. It attacks only if PCs attempt to take the crown without destroying it. If PCs destroy the crown, the devil dissipates peacefully with a nod of approval.

**Success:** Activating the exit rune teleports the entire party back to the Central Hub, where the **Exit Portal** now glows on the South side, allowing escape.

### West Chamber (Scale's Balance) - **FALSE PATH**

**Puzzle:** Room has a massive set of scales in the center. One side holds a stone labeled "Truth" (weighs 100 lbs), the other side is empty. An inscription reads:

*"Balance the scales with equal weight, but truth alone will seal your fate."*

**Solution:** PCs must place exactly 100 lbs of **items they find meaningful** (not just rocks or junk) on the empty side. This requires roleplay—PCs must declare why each item matters (weapon representing their honor, memento from backstory, etc.). If balanced correctly, a **golden key** appears.

**Twist:** The golden key opens a trapdoor beneath the scales, dropping PCs 20 feet into a pit with 1d4 **Swarms of Poisonous Snakes** (CR 2 each). Escaping requires climbing (Athletics DC 14) or destroying the snakes.

**Guardian:** 1 **Invisible Stalker** (CR 6; **Flex**: use Wraith CR 5 for 4 PCs) that observes silently. It attacks only if PCs attempt to cheat the scales (using magic to alter weight, etc.).

## Enemies and Flex Scaling

### 4 PCs
- Chain Devil in South Chamber: CR 6 (HP 60).
- Remove Invisible Stalker from West Chamber; use 1 Wraith instead.
- Reduce Fire Elemental to CR 3 (HP 40).

### 5-6 PCs
- Use full stat blocks as listed above.
- Add 1 **Spectator** (CR 3) in Central Hub that activates on Round 6, firing eye rays at PCs to pressure them into making faster decisions.

## Time Pressure and Hazards

- **Contracting Walls:** Every 3 rounds, the Central Hub shrinks by 5 feet diameter. Round 12 = crushing trap (10d10 damage).
- **Wrong Door Penalties:** Each failed chamber (North, East, West) triggers a consequence:
  - North: Summons 2 Basilisks to Central Hub.
  - East: Fire Elemental attacks for 2 rounds.
  - West: Trapdoor pit trap with snakes.
- **Wandering Threat:** On Round 8, if PCs haven't completed the South Chamber, a **Bone Devil** (CR 9, reduced HP to 90) appears in the Central Hub, forcing PCs to fight or flee into a chamber.

## Crowd Favor Hooks

- Identify the correct door (South) through clues alone (no trial-and-error): +3 [[crowds_favor|Favor]].
- Destroy the crown in the South Chamber with [[panache|Panache]]: +2 Favor.
- Solve a false chamber's puzzle despite recognizing it's a trap (for style): +1 Favor.
- Convince the Azer or Chain Devil to assist or stand down: +1 Favor each.
- Escape the Central Hub before Round 10 (before walls become deadly): +2 Favor for speed.
- Save a dominated ally without harming them (if someone wears the crown): +1 Favor.

## Announcer Beats

- Opening: "BEHOLD! The Proving Chambers! Four doors, four fates! Which will they choose? Will they prove their wit—or their folly?"
- First door opened: "They enter the [North/East/South/West] Chamber! Confidence or desperation? The crowd holds its breath!"
- Wrong chamber completed: "A KEY! But wait—it's a TRAP! [Basilisks/Fire/Snakes] unleashed! Clever, but not clever enough!"
- Crown destroyed: "THE CROWN SHATTERS! Rebellion! Defiance! The South Door OPENS!"
- Walls contracting: "The walls CLOSE IN! Time runs short! Decide quickly, gladiators!"
- Victory: "They've BROKEN FREE! The Proving Chambers yield to those who refuse to kneel! TARSUS ROARS!"

## GM Tips

- **Pre-Game Prep:** Print or prepare handouts with the door verses and gemstone visions. Let players reference them freely.
- **Clue Breadcrumbs:** If PCs struggle, have the crowd chant hints ("Break the crown!" "Defy the king!") or the announcer drop subtle clues.
- **Parallel Exploration:** Allow PCs to split up and tackle multiple chambers simultaneously (increases tension and time pressure).
- **False Success:** Make the false chambers' puzzles solvable and rewarding (keys, treasure) so failure feels earned, not cheap.
- **Crown Domination:** If a PC wears the crown, roleplay their internal struggle (give them a chance to break free with subsequent saves each round, DC 13, 12, 11...).
- **Time Tracking:** Use a visible timer or countdown for wall contraction. Announce each contraction dramatically.
- **Exit Reveal:** When the South Chamber is completed, describe the Exit Portal opening with light, warmth, and crowd cheers—make it feel triumphant.

## Aftermath Seeds

- **Patron Interest:** Mystery patron impressed by PC's deduction; offers contract for espionage or puzzle-solving work (cryptic note delivered to inn).
- **Rumor:** The Proving Chambers were designed by an exiled archmage seeking worthy apprentices; they may appear again with harder tests.
- **Downtime:** Shattered crown pieces can be sold (100 gp total) or reforged into **Circlet of Defiant Will** (advantage on saves vs. domination, 1/day).
- **Injury:** PC who wore the crown develops nightmares of commanding armies (disadvantage on Wisdom saves for 1d4 days).
- **Political:** Arena management hires PCs to test future puzzle chambers (side quest: infiltrate rival arena as "quality control").
- **Loot:** If PCs examine the exit rune closely (Investigation DC 16), they find a **Scroll of Teleportation Circle** hidden beneath it.
