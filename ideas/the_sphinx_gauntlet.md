# The Sphinx's Gauntlet

## Hook
A captured sphinx has made a deal with the arena masters: she'll provide the spectacle if she gets to test worthy minds. Three chambers, three riddles, three escalating dangers. Answer correctly and the path opens. Answer wrong, and the room tries to kill you.

## Structure
Three chambers in sequence, each with:
1. A riddle posed by the Sphinx (illusory projection)
2. Environmental danger while solving
3. Enemies guarding the answer

### Chamber 1: The Room of Flames

**Riddle**: "I am not alive, but I grow. I don't have lungs, but I need air. I don't have a mouth, but water kills me. What am I?"

**Answer**: Fire

**The Room**:
- 30 x 30 ft chamber with 4 unlit braziers (corners)
- Fire begins spreading from the center (5 ft radius, expanding 5 ft per round)
- Correct answer = fire extinguishes, door opens
- Wrong answer = fire explodes (2d6 fire damage to all in room)

**Environmental Danger**: The spreading fire forces movement toward the walls
**Enemies**: 2 **Fire Snakes** (CR 1)—guard the braziers, can be killed to slow fire spread

**Hint Mechanic**: Each brazier has a symbol—examining them (DC 12 Investigation) reveals the symbols form the word "FIRE" in an ancient script

### Chamber 2: The Room of Echoes

**Riddle**: "The more you take, the more you leave behind. What am I?"

**Answer**: Footsteps

**The Room**:
- 40 x 40 ft chamber with floor divided into tiles
- Each tile lights up when stepped on and stays lit
- Pattern of lit tiles must spell "STEPS" (in the room's ancient script) to open door
- Correct answer = door opens, all lit tiles heal party (1d6 each)
- Wrong answer = all lit tiles shock (1d4 lightning damage per lit tile)

**Environmental Danger**: The more you move incorrectly, the harder the shock punishment
**Enemies**: 3 **Animated Armors** (CR 1)—stomp around randomly, lighting wrong tiles, adding to potential damage

**Hint Mechanic**: The Animated Armors stomp in a pattern—observing for 1 round (DC 14 Perception) reveals they're avoiding certain tiles (the correct path)

### Chamber 3: The Room of Shadows

**Riddle**: "I have cities, but no houses. I have mountains, but no trees. I have water, but no fish. What am I?"

**Answer**: A map

**The Room**:
- 50 x 50 ft chamber in complete darkness
- Four murals on walls (only visible with light): city, mountain, ocean, forest
- Must touch the murals in order that matches the riddle (city → mountain → water → skip forest)
- Correct answer = lights return, Sphinx appears, door to victory
- Wrong answer = shadows attack (2d6 necrotic damage, lose 1 light source permanently)

**Environmental Danger**: Darkness + enemies with blindsight
**Enemies**: 4 **Shadows** (CR 1/2)—hunt in the dark, retreat if light is brought to murals

**Hint Mechanic**: The floor has raised texture—running fingers along it (DC 12 Perception, requires being near ground) reveals the outline of a MAP carved into the stone

## The Sphinx
- **Sekhara the Bound**—gynosphinx forced into arena service
- Appears as golden projection in each chamber
- Delivers riddles with theatrical flair but genuine respect for intelligence
- If party solves all three riddles, she offers a boon (see Aftermath)

### Sphinx's Demeanor
- Amused by wrong answers, not cruel
- Genuinely impressed by correct answers
- If party struggles, gives one free hint per chamber (but notes their "assistance needed")
- If party aces all three: "Worthy. Truly worthy."

## Crowd's Favor Opportunities
- Solve riddle without hints: +2 Favor per chamber
- Solve riddle under pressure (while taking damage): +1 Favor
- Panache when delivering the answer (dramatic, loud, theatrical)
- Help an ally reach the answer (teamwork): +1 Favor
- Defeat all enemies in a chamber without solving riddle (brute force): -1 Favor (crowd prefers cleverness)

## Scaling
- **3 PCs**: Remove 1 enemy per chamber, add extra hint automatically
- **5 PCs**: Add 1 enemy per chamber, riddles must be solved in fewer rounds (3 instead of 5)

## Announcer Beats
- "The SPHINX tests MINDS as well as MUSCLE! Think, gladiators, THINK!"
- Wrong answer: "WRONG! The room PUNISHES! But they can try AGAIN!"
- Correct answer: "BRILLIANT! The door OPENS! The Sphinx is PLEASED!"
- All chambers cleared: "THREE FOR THREE! The Sphinx herself APPLAUDS!"

## GM Tips
- Let players discuss openly—riddles are fun, not frustrating if collaborative
- If stuck for 5+ minutes, have an enemy accidentally reveal a hint (dying words, etc.)
- The Sphinx should feel like a fair challenger, not a trap
- Emphasize the spectacle—crowd gasps at wrong answers, cheers at correct ones

## Aftermath Seeds
- **Sphinx's Boon** (if all three solved): Choose one—
  - **Riddle's Blessing**: Once per day, ask DM a yes/no question about environment (DC 15 Insight to interpret cryptic answer)
  - **Sphinx's Mark**: Advantage on one Intelligence check per long rest
  - **Gauntlet Champion**: Reputation as "the clever ones"—scholar patrons take interest
- If any riddle failed: Sphinx remembers, will test again in future session (harder riddles)
- Fire Snakes' scales = 30 gp (fire-resistant crafting)
- Map on floor can be copied—reveals hidden passage in the arena (downtime exploration)
