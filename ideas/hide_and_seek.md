# Hide and Seek

- **Hook:** The arena goes dark. Hunters stalk the sands with your names on their lips. Survive 10 rounds without being "announced"—but if a hunter reaches a pillar and shouts your name, the crowd's magic executes you where you stand.
- **Party:** 4-6 PCs, level 3+. Emphasize stealth, mobility, and preventing enemies from reaching objectives.

## Arena Layout
- Sprawling nighttime arena (120x120 feet) lit only by four **Announcement Pillars** (stone obelisks, 15 feet tall, glowing faintly blue).
- Pillars located at North, South, East, West edges of arena (30 feet from center, evenly spaced).
- Terrain: scattered stone blocks (5-10 feet tall, provide full cover), canvas awnings (half cover, can be collapsed), sand dunes (difficult terrain, shift positions slightly each round).
- Central pit (20-foot diameter) contains **The Hourglass of Dread**—massive magical timer counting down 10 rounds; visible to all.
- Crowd watches via scrying illusions; gladiators operate in dim light (lightly obscured beyond 60 feet).

## Core Mechanic: Announcement Pillars
Each Announcement Pillar is a stone obelisk (AC 17, 75 HP, immune to poison/psychic).

### Announcing a Gladiator
- A hunter (enemy) must spend an **action** while **adjacent to a pillar** to "announce" a PC.
- Hunter must **know the PC's name** and **have seen them within the last 3 rounds** (line-of-sight, no more than 60 feet away).
- Upon successful announcement, arcane magic targets that PC:
  - PC hears their name boom across arena (no save).
  - PC must make **Wisdom save DC 15** at start of their next turn.
  - **Failure:** PC drops to 0 HP instantly (crowd's magic strikes them down).
  - **Success:** PC resists but takes 4d10 force damage and is **marked** (glowing faintly; disadvantage on Stealth for 1 minute).

### Preventing Announcements
- PCs can destroy pillars (AC 17, 75 HP each) to eliminate announcement sites.
- PCs can grapple, shove, or kill hunters before they reach pillars.
- PCs can use *silence*, *darkness*, or terrain to obscure hunter movements.
- PCs can hide or disguise themselves to avoid being "seen" (hunter needs line-of-sight within 3 rounds).

## Enemies (The Hunters)
Hunters are trained assassins and trackers; they **prioritize reaching pillars over killing PCs directly** (though they'll fight if cornered).

### 4 PCs
- 3 **Shadow Stalkers** (use Assassin, CR 8; reduced HP to 60 each; have *pass without trace*, expertise in Stealth).
- 2 **Hound Masters** (use Scout, CR 1/2; each commands 1 **Shadow Hound** [reskin Dire Wolf with darkvision 120 ft.]).

### 5 PCs
- 4 Shadow Stalkers.
- 2 Hound Masters + 2 Shadow Hounds.

### 6 PCs
- 5 Shadow Stalkers.
- 3 Hound Masters + 3 Shadow Hounds.
- Add 1 **Veilwalker** (use Invisible Stalker, CR 6; scouts for hunters, relays PC positions via telepathy).

### Hunter Tactics
- Stalkers use Stealth heavily; attempt to observe PCs, learn names (from shouted callouts or eavesdropping), then dash to pillars.
- Hound Masters send hounds to harry PCs; use distractions to cover Stalker movements.
- Veilwalker (if present) shadows PCs, reports positions telepathically to Stalkers (50-foot range).
- Hunters **do not fight to the death**; if a pillar is destroyed, they relocate to another. If all pillars fall, they retreat (PCs win).

## Objectives
- **Primary:** Survive 10 rounds without any PC being successfully announced and killed.
- **Secondary:** Destroy all four Announcement Pillars (bonus Favor; also prevents all announcements).
- **Tertiary:** Kill at least half the hunters (bonus Favor for aggression).

## Round Timer
The **Hourglass of Dread** counts down publicly (visible magical display):
- Rounds 1-5: Sand flows normally; crowd murmurs; tension builds.
- Rounds 6-8: Sand accelerates; announcer hypes danger; hunters gain +10 movement speed.
- Rounds 9-10: Sand nearly empty; crowd chants countdown; hunters gain advantage on attacks and Stealth.

If PCs survive to the end of Round 10, the hourglass shatters; hunters flee; PCs win.

## Crowd Favor Hooks
- Successfully hide from a hunter for 3+ consecutive rounds: +1 [[crowds_favor_mechanic|Favor]].
- Destroy an Announcement Pillar: +2 Favor (dramatic defiance).
- Prevent a hunter from announcing by grappling/stunning them at pillar: +2 Favor.
- Kill a Shadow Stalker with [[panache_mechanics|Panache]]: +2 Favor.
- Survive being **marked** (failed save but didn't drop to 0 HP): +1 Favor for resilience.
- Distract hunters to protect another PC (draw attacks, create opening): +1 Favor to both.
- Win without destroying any pillars (pure stealth/survival): +3 Favor for restraint.

## Tactical Elements
- **Stealth Over Combat:** Hunters are deadly; direct fights favor them. PCs should use terrain, hit-and-run, ambushes.
- **Pillar Dilemma:** Destroy pillars (prevents announcements, loud/visible) vs. preserve pillars (hide better, avoid attention).
- **Name Awareness:** PCs should avoid shouting each other's names; use codenames or gestures to coordinate.
- **Terrain Manipulation:** Collapse awnings to create barriers; shift sand dunes to obscure sight lines; topple stone blocks onto hunters.
- **Hound Harassment:** Hounds track by scent (advantage on Survival to track); killing them reduces hunter intel.
- **Veilwalker Threat:** Invisible scout is low HP (90) but high mobility; detecting and killing it cripples hunter coordination.

## Hazards and Twists
- **Shifting Sands:** Each round, 1d3 sand dunes move 10 feet in random directions (difficult terrain repositions; DM adjusts map).
- **Scrying Eyes:** Crowd sees everything via magic; occasionally announcer shouts out a PC's location ("I see you, Kael, near the east pillar!"). PC must make Stealth check DC 15 or hunters gain advantage to find them next round.
- **Pillar Explosion:** If a pillar is destroyed, it erupts in arcane energy (20-foot radius, 3d8 force damage, Dex save DC 14 for half). Hunters caught in blast also take damage.
- **Round 7 Twist:** Announcer declares, "The hunt intensifies!" One random PC's name is shouted; all hunters know their approximate location (10-foot radius revealed for 1 round).

## Announcer Beats
- Opening: "Ten rounds. Four pillars. Your names are weapons. **Run, hide, survive—or be announced into oblivion!**"
- First hunter reaches pillar: "A Stalker grips the pillar! Whose name will they scream?!"
- First announcement attempt: "THE NAME IS SPOKEN! [PC name], the crowd's magic seeks you! **Will you fall?!**"
- Pillar destroyed: "Stone shatters! Defiance! But three pillars remain!"
- Round 7: "Halfway through the hunt! The hourglass spins faster! **Nowhere is safe!**"
- Round 10, final seconds: "Ten! Nine! Eight! ...Survive these last heartbeats! **Can they outlast the hunt?!**"
- Victory: "The hourglass shatters! The hunters flee! **They survived the unspeakable!** Tarsus erupts!"

## GM Tips
- **Track Visibility:** Enforce "seen within last 3 rounds" rule strictly. Hunters must have line-of-sight recently to announce.
- **Name Discipline:** Penalize PCs who shout names carelessly; hunters listening (Perception DC 12) learn names from shouted callouts.
- **Hunter Behavior:** Hunters prioritize pillars over kills; they'll disengage if attacked, dash to nearest pillar, attempt announcement. Only fight to kill if cornered.
- **Stealth Checks:** Call for frequent Stealth vs. Perception rolls; don't auto-reveal PCs. Let clever positioning and terrain use shine.
- **Pillar Destruction:** Make it risky—loud, visible, attracts hunters. But eliminates announcement threat permanently.
- **Veilwalker Intel:** If present, have Veilwalker relay PC positions via telepathy ("Three near center, one heading east"). Increase tension.
- **Hourglass Visual:** Describe sand draining vividly; use Roll20/Foundry timer overlay if available. Countdown creates urgency.
- **Crowd Callouts:** Once per 2-3 rounds, announcer shouts a PC's rough location (based on scrying). Not exact, but narrows search area.

## Aftermath Seeds
- **Patron Interest:** Shadowy guild master impressed by stealth; offers contract for "discreet removals" or spy network access.
- **Rumor:** The Announcement Pillars are experimental arcane weapons; patron who sponsored them is furious at destruction (if pillars destroyed). Political fallout.
- **Downtime:** PC who survived an announcement (made the save) gains paranoia (disadvantage on Wisdom saves vs. fear for 1d4 days).
- **Injury:** PC who failed announcement save but was revived (via *revivify* or similar) carries **Marked by the Crowd** (permanent faint glow unless dispelled; disadvantage on Stealth in dim light or darker).
- **Political:** Assassins' guild claims the hunt was rigged unfairly; demands rematch or compensation. Patron drama ensues.
- **Loot:** Destroyed Announcement Pillar yields **Arcane Resonance Crystal** (can be attuned to learn *sending* once per day; 150 gp value; 1 per destroyed pillar).
