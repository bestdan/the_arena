# Temporal Crucible

- **Hook:** "PAST! PRESENT! FUTURE! ALL COLLIDE!" The arena shifts through three time periods of the same location every 2 rounds—ancient ruins (past), current construction site (present), and finished grand palace (future). The same enemies exist in all three timelines simultaneously, but injuries and deaths echo across time. Kill a creature in the past, and its future self vanishes. The crowd watches three timelines on arcane displays, placing bets on which timeline falls first.
- **Party:** 4-6 PCs, level 6+. Tests strategic thinking, temporal coordination, and understanding cause-effect across timelines. Extremely complex tactical puzzle.

## Opening Presentation
- Before combat, arena chronomancer demonstrates the three timelines:
  - **"Behold the ANCIENT RUINS—where this palace was born 1,000 years ago!"** (crumbling stone, overgrown with vines)
  - **"Now the PRESENT—construction underway, scaffolding and half-built walls!"** (workers flee, tools scattered)
  - **"And finally, the FUTURE—the grand palace COMPLETED, gleaming in eternal glory!"** (pristine marble, chandeliers)
- Three arcane hourglasses above arena show which timeline is active (sand flows through active one).
- PCs learn rotation: Past → Present → Future → repeat every 2 rounds.
- **CRITICAL:** "Actions in the past echo forward! Kill in the past, erase the future!"

## Timeline Rotation (100-foot square, shifts every 2 rounds)

### Ancient Ruins - The Past (Rounds 1-2, 7-8, 13-14)
**"Crumbling foundation where the palace was first built"**
- **Terrain:** Broken stone floors (difficult terrain), 4 ruined columns (15 feet tall, crumbling—AC 12, 20 HP, collapse creates 10-foot hazard zone).
- **Overgrown Vines:** Vines cover walls (Athletics DC 12 to climb, can be burned to create smoke).
- **Ancient Altar:** Central stone altar (immovable, provides full cover, has 3 unlit braziers).
- **Unstable Ground:** Cracks in floor (if column collapses, 20-foot-radius area becomes pit trap DC 15 Dex or fall 10 feet).
- **Temporal Note:** This is the "source" timeline—effects here propagate forward.

### Construction Site - The Present (Rounds 3-4, 9-10, 15-16)
**"Half-built palace with scaffolding and hazards"**
- **Terrain:** Wooden scaffolding (20 feet tall, climbable DC 10, provides half cover), stone blocks scattered (half cover).
- **Crane:** Large wooden crane in center (can be operated to swing stone block as improvised weapon—DC 13 Athletics to control, 4d10 bludgeoning in 10-foot line).
- **Exposed Walls:** Three partially built walls (10 feet tall, climbable, stone blocks can be pushed off to attack below).
- **Sawdust Piles:** Three piles of sawdust (can be ignited—creates 15-foot-radius smoke, heavily obscured).
- **Temporal Note:** Inherits some features from Past (if column collapsed in Past, this area has pit in same location).

### Grand Palace - The Future (Rounds 5-6, 11-12, 17-18)
**"Completed palace with opulent features"**
- **Terrain:** Polished marble floors (non-difficult, excellent footing), 4 pristine columns (25 feet tall, carved marble, AC 17, 50 HP).
- **Chandeliers:** Three crystal chandeliers (15 feet above ground, can be shot down—DC 14 attack, fall deals 3d6 slashing in 10-foot radius).
- **Grand Staircase:** Central 20-foot-wide staircase leads to 15-foot-high balcony (overlooks arena, provides high ground).
- **Tapestries:** Four large tapestries on walls (can be pulled down to create difficult terrain or extinguish fire).
- **Temporal Note:** Reflects completed Past/Present—if braziers lit in Past, chandeliers glow brighter here (+5 feet light radius, helps visibility).

## Temporal Shift Mechanic
- **At Initiative Count 20 on even-numbered rounds:** Reality flickers—time shifts forward (or loops back to Past after Future).
- **Warning:** At initiative 12 the round BEFORE shift, hourglass sand accelerates visibly—announcer shouts: "TIME TURNS! The [next era] approaches!"
- **Positional Translation:**
  - Ruined column (Past) → scaffolding (Present) → pristine column (Future)
  - Altar (Past) → crane (Present) → grand staircase (Future)
  - Ground cracks (Past) → construction pit (Present) → marble floor (Future—sealed unless pit was made)
  
## Temporal Echo Mechanic (THE CORE PUZZLE)
**"Kill in the past—erase the future."**

### How It Works:
- Each enemy exists in **all three timelines simultaneously** (treat as three separate creatures with shared identity).
- **Temporal HP Pool:** When an enemy takes damage in ANY timeline, its HP reduces across ALL timelines.
- **Timeline Death:** If an enemy reaches 0 HP in a timeline, it dies in THAT timeline only.
- **Temporal Erasure:** If an enemy dies in the PAST timeline, it is erased from PRESENT and FUTURE (all instances vanish immediately).
- **Paradox Prevention:** Enemies killed in PRESENT persist in PAST but vanish in FUTURE. Enemies killed in FUTURE persist in PAST and PRESENT.

### Strategic Implications:
- **Most Efficient:** Kill enemies in Past timeline = removes them from all three timelines.
- **Least Efficient:** Kill in Future timeline = leaves Past and Present copies alive.
- **Tactical Trade-off:** Past timeline is earliest (rounds 1-2), but returns later—do you rush kills in Past, or survive until it rotates back?

### Example:
- **Round 1 (Past):** Temporal Knight has 100 HP. Party deals 40 damage. Knight now at 60 HP across all timelines.
- **Round 3 (Present):** Same Temporal Knight has 60 HP. Party deals 30 more damage. Now at 30 HP across all timelines.
- **Round 5 (Future):** Same Temporal Knight has 30 HP. Party deals 20 damage (reducing to 10 HP shared), then moves away. Knight still exists in all timelines at 10 HP.
- **Round 7 (Past returns):** Knight reappears in Past with 10 HP remaining (shared pool). If killed NOW in Past, vanishes from all timelines retroactively.

## Enemies (Temporal Guardians, exist across all timelines)

### Core Enemies (share HP pool across timelines)
- **Temporal Knight** (CR 5; 100 HP shared; longsword, multiattack, temporal duplicate ability).
  - **Past:** Rusted armor (-1 AC), disadvantage on Dex saves (old joints).
  - **Present:** Standard stats, wields half-finished sword (-1 damage).
  - **Future:** Gleaming armor (+1 AC), advantage on saves vs. magic (enchanted).

- **Chrono Mage** (CR 6; 70 HP shared; *slow*, *haste*, *hold person*, *blink*).
  - **Past:** Ancient robes, disadvantage on initiative (old and slow).
  - **Present:** Standard stats, can cast *time stop* 1/day (only in Present).
  - **Future:** Mastered magic, advantage on concentration checks.

- **Paradox Beast** (CR 7; 120 HP shared; multiattack, temporal bite causes slow effect, phase between timelines).
  - **Past:** Young and reckless, +10 speed but -2 AC.
  - **Present:** Standard stats, can phase to adjacent timeline as bonus action (shifts to Past or Future if available).
  - **Future:** Aged and cunning, +2 AC but -10 speed, advantage on Wisdom saves.

- **2 Temporal Archers** (CR 3 each; 50 HP shared per archer; longbows, rapid shot, temporal step).
  - **Past:** Primitive bows, -1 to attack rolls.
  - **Present:** Standard stats, mobile (Dash as bonus action).
  - **Future:** Advanced bows, +1 to attack rolls, +10 feet range.

**Flex:** For 4 PCs, remove 1 Temporal Archer and reduce Paradox Beast HP to 90. For 6 PCs, add 1 Time Elemental (CR 5, 80 HP shared, temporal distortion aura causes slow effect).

## Enemy Temporal Tactics
- **Strategic Timeline Defense:** Enemies prioritize defending Past timeline (prevents erasure).
  - Temporal Knight guards Past altar.
  - Chrono Mage casts *slow* to prevent PCs from reaching Past during critical rounds.
  - Paradox Beast phases to Past when bloodied (harder to finish off).

- **Exploitation:** Enemies try to waste PC time in Present/Future:
  - Archers kite in Future (pristine columns provide cover).
  - Chrono Mage uses *blink* in Future to evade damage.
  - Paradox Beast taunts PCs: "You waste time in this timeline! We are eternal!"

## Crowd Favor Hooks
- Kill an enemy in the Past (causing erasure across all timelines): +3 [[crowds_favor|Favor]] for temporal mastery.
- Damage the same enemy in all three timelines in consecutive rounds: +2 Favor for persistence.
- Prevent Paradox Beast from phasing to Past (kill it in Present/Future before it escapes): +2 Favor for strategic denial.
- Use environmental feature across timelines (collapse column in Past, use pit in Present, bypass obstacle in Future): +2 Favor for temporal thinking.
- [[panache|Panache]] strike that kills enemy in Past right as timeline shifts: +4 Favor for perfect timing.
- Deduce temporal echo mechanic within first 3 rounds (player insight): +2 Favor for intelligence.
- Light all 3 braziers in Past altar (unlocks bonus—Future chandeliers explode dealing 4d6 radiant in 20-foot radius to enemies): +3 Favor for puzzle-solving.

## Announcer Beats
- **Opening:** "TEMPORAL CRUCIBLE! One battle! Three timelines! Can they grasp the paradox—or be lost in TIME?!"
- **First shift (Past → Present):** "A THOUSAND YEARS IN A HEARTBEAT! Time LEAPS forward!"
- **Present → Future:** "The palace RISES! Behold the GLORY yet to come!"
- **Future → Past:** "Time CIRCLES! The loop closes! All begins AGAIN!"
- **Temporal erasure:** "ERASED FROM HISTORY! The knight falls in the PAST—and VANISHES from all futures! IMPOSSIBLE!"
- **Shared damage reveal:** "WAIT! The wound in the present appears in the future! Time BLEEDS through!"
- **Paradox Beast phase:** "It flees through TIME ITSELF! Chase it across eras!"
- **Puzzle solve (braziers):** "The ancient fires IGNITE! The future chandeliers EXPLODE with light! BRILLIANT!"
- **Victory:** "They've conquered TIME! Past, present, future—all FALL! The arena witnesses ETERNITY bent!"

## GM Tips
- **Visual Tracking:** Use three mini-maps or VTT layers side-by-side labeled "PAST," "PRESENT," "FUTURE." Show all three simultaneously.
- **HP Tracking:** Keep one shared HP tracker per enemy with notation "(across all timelines)."
- **Timeline Tokens:** Use different colored tokens/borders for same enemy in different timelines (Past = sepia, Present = full color, Future = bright/gleaming).
- **Erasure Drama:** When enemy killed in Past, remove all tokens dramatically—"They fade from existence in Present and Future—never existed!"
- **Player Education:** First round, have NPC announcer or Chrono Mage taunt: "Fool! You damage me in the future—but I still exist in the past! Kill me there, or I endure!"
- **Temporal Carryover:** Track environmental changes (collapsed columns, lit braziers) across timelines visibly.
- **Complexity Management:** This is an ADVANCED puzzle—ensure players understand shared HP mechanic by round 3. Use diagrams if needed.
- **Pacing:** Encourage strategic discussion during timeline shifts (12-second warning gives planning window).

## Aftermath Seeds
- **Temporal Scars:** PCs who survived all three timelines gain "Chrono-Touched" trait—occasional déjà vu visions of alternate timelines (DM gives hints about future events 1/session, cryptic).
- **Patron Interest:** Time-obsessed wizard impressed by "temporal stability"—offers contract to retrieve artifact from past era (time travel mission, extremely dangerous).
- **Rumor:** The arena's temporal magic damaged Tarsus's timeline—people report "echoes" of themselves from alternate timelines (doppelgangers with different life choices appearing).
- **Downtime:** Chrono Mage's staff can be claimed—allows wielder to cast *haste* 1/day, but ages them 1 year per use (cosmetic aging, no mechanical effect until extreme overuse).
- **Injury:** PC who died in Present or Future timeline (but not Past—those are permanent erasures) develops "Temporal Instability" after resurrection—occasionally phases translucent for 1d4 seconds (cosmetic, unsettling reminder of their brush with temporal erasure).
- **Legendary Moment:** If PCs killed all enemies in Past timeline (perfect temporal strategy), time scholars request interview for paradox study—gain feat: "Temporal Intuition" (+1 Initiative, advantage on Perception checks to detect time magic).
- **Political:** Arena's time magic violates Tarsus chronomancy laws (forbidden by empire after "The Unraveling" 200 years ago)—magistrates investigate, arena risks closure, PCs subpoenaed as witnesses.
- **Loot:** Temporal Knight's sword exists in all three timelines simultaneously—grants +1 longsword that deals extra 1d6 force damage (temporal strike), once per day can "rewind" attack (reroll attack roll, take better result).
