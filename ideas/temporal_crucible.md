# Temporal Crucible

- **Hook:** "PAST! PRESENT! FUTURE! ALL COLLIDE!" The arena shifts through three time periods of the same location every 2 rounds—ancient ruins (past), current construction site (present), and finished grand palace (future). The same enemies exist in all three timelines simultaneously, but injuries and deaths echo across time. Kill a creature in the past, and its future self vanishes. The crowd watches three timelines on arcane displays, placing bets on which timeline falls first.
- **Party:** 4-6 PCs, level 6+. Tests strategic thinking, temporal coordination, and understanding cause-effect across timelines. Extremely complex tactical puzzle.

## Opening Presentation
- Before combat, arena chronomancer demonstrates the three timelines:
  - **"Behold the ANCIENT RUINS—where this palace was born 1,000 years ago!"** (crumbling stone, overgrown with vines)
  - **"Now the PRESENT—construction underway, scaffolding and half-built walls!"** (workers flee, tools scattered)
  - **"And finally, the FUTURE—the grand palace COMPLETED, gleaming in eternal glory!"** (pristine marble, chandeliers)
- Three arcane hourglasses above arena show which timeline is active (sand flows through active one).
- PCs learn rotation: Past → Present → Future → repeat every 2 rounds.
- **CRITICAL:** "Actions in the past echo forward! Kill in the past, erase the future!"

## Timeline Rotation (100-foot square, shifts every 2 rounds)

### Ancient Ruins - The Past (Rounds 1-2, 7-8, 13-14)
**"Crumbling foundation where the palace was first built"**
- **Terrain:** Broken stone floors (difficult terrain), 4 ruined columns (15 feet tall, crumbling—AC 12, 20 HP, collapse creates 10-foot hazard zone).
- **Overgrown Vines:** Vines cover walls (Athletics DC 12 to climb, can be burned to create smoke).
- **Ancient Altar:** Central stone altar (immovable, provides full cover, has 3 unlit braziers).
- **Unstable Ground:** Cracks in floor (if column collapses, 20-foot-radius area becomes pit trap DC 15 Dex or fall 10 feet).
- **Temporal Note:** This is the "source" timeline—effects here propagate forward.

### Construction Site - The Present (Rounds 3-4, 9-10, 15-16)
**"Half-built palace with scaffolding and hazards"**
- **Terrain:** Wooden scaffolding (20 feet tall, climbable DC 10, provides half cover), stone blocks scattered (half cover).
- **Crane:** Large wooden crane in center (can be operated to swing stone block as improvised weapon—DC 13 Athletics to control, 4d10 bludgeoning in 10-foot line).
- **Exposed Walls:** Three partially built walls (10 feet tall, climbable, stone blocks can be pushed off to attack below).
- **Sawdust Piles:** Three piles of sawdust (can be ignited—creates 15-foot-radius smoke, heavily obscured).
- **Temporal Note:** Inherits some features from Past (if column collapsed in Past, this area has pit in same location).

### Grand Palace - The Future (Rounds 5-6, 11-12, 17-18)
**"Completed palace with opulent features"**
- **Terrain:** Polished marble floors (non-difficult, excellent footing), 4 pristine columns (25 feet tall, carved marble, AC 17, 50 HP).
- **Chandeliers:** Three crystal chandeliers (15 feet above ground, can be shot down—DC 14 attack, fall deals 3d6 slashing in 10-foot radius).
- **Grand Staircase:** Central 20-foot-wide staircase leads to 15-foot-high balcony (overlooks arena, provides high ground).
- **Tapestries:** Four large tapestries on walls (can be pulled down to create difficult terrain or extinguish fire).
- **Temporal Note:** Reflects completed Past/Present—if braziers lit in Past, chandeliers glow brighter here (+5 feet light radius, helps visibility).

## Temporal Shift Mechanic
- **At Initiative Count 20 on even-numbered rounds:** Reality flickers—time shifts forward (or loops back to Past after Future).
- **Warning:** At initiative 12 the round BEFORE shift, hourglass sand accelerates visibly—announcer shouts: "TIME TURNS! The [next era] approaches!"
- **Positional Translation:**
  - Ruined column (Past) → scaffolding (Present) → pristine column (Future)
  - Altar (Past) → crane (Present) → grand staircase (Future)
  - Ground cracks (Past) → construction pit (Present) → marble floor (Future—sealed unless pit was made)
  
## Temporal Echo Mechanic (THE CORE PUZZLE)
**"Kill in the past—erase the future."**

### How It Works:
- Each enemy exists in **all three timelines simultaneously** (treat as three separate creatures with shared identity).
- **Action Economy:** All instances of the same enemy act on one shared initiative count, but take separate turns in their respective timelines (e.g., Temporal Knight rolls initiative once; acts in Past on round 1, Present on round 3, Future on round 5, etc.).
- **Temporal HP Pool:** When an enemy takes damage in ANY timeline, its HP reduces across ALL timelines.
- **Timeline Death:** If an enemy reaches 0 HP in a timeline, it dies in THAT timeline only.
- **Temporal Erasure:** If an enemy dies in the PAST timeline, it is erased from PRESENT and FUTURE (all instances vanish immediately).
- **Paradox Prevention:** Enemies killed in PRESENT persist in PAST but vanish in FUTURE. Enemies killed in FUTURE persist in PAST and PRESENT.

### Strategic Implications:
- **Most Efficient:** Kill enemies in Past timeline = removes them from all three timelines.
- **Least Efficient:** Kill in Future timeline = leaves Past and Present copies alive.
- **Tactical Trade-off:** Past timeline is earliest (rounds 1-2), but returns later—do you rush kills in Past, or survive until it rotates back?

### Example:
- **Round 1 (Past):** Temporal Knight has 100 HP. Party deals 40 damage. Knight now at 60 HP across all timelines.
- **Round 3 (Present):** Same Temporal Knight has 60 HP. Party deals 30 more damage. Now at 30 HP across all timelines.
- **Round 5 (Future):** Same Temporal Knight has 30 HP. Party deals 20 damage (reducing to 10 HP shared), then moves away. Knight still exists in all timelines at 10 HP.
- **Round 7 (Past returns):** Knight reappears in Past with 10 HP remaining (shared pool). If killed NOW in Past, vanishes from all timelines retroactively.

## Asymmetric Temporal Puzzle (ADVANCED)
**"Some enemies must be avoided; others must be pursued."**

When including **Chrono-Spawn** and/or **Echo Revenant**, players face a multi-layered strategic puzzle:

### The Core Dilemma:
- **Chrono-Spawn:** A *ticking time bomb*—vulnerable in Past, deadly in Future. Players must prioritize killing it EARLY or face an overwhelming threat later.
- **Echo Revenant:** A *patient hunt*—invulnerable in Past, vulnerable in Future. Players must RESIST attacking it early and wait for the right moment.

### Strategic Tension:
- **Action Economy:** Should players spend actions in Past (vulnerable Chrono-Spawn) or save resources for other threats?
- **Timeline Pressure:** Chrono-Spawn forces urgency in Past rounds; Echo Revenant rewards patience until Future rounds.
- **Resource Management:** Wasting attacks on invulnerable Echo Revenant (Past) or resistant Chrono-Spawn (Future) depletes party resources.
- **Enemy Coordination:** Standard temporal enemies may protect Chrono-Spawn in Past or bait PCs into attacking Echo Revenant.

### Victory Conditions:
- **Optimal Strategy:** Kill Chrono-Spawn in Past timeline before it matures; ignore Echo Revenant until Future timeline when vulnerable.
- **Risky Strategy:** Allow Chrono-Spawn to reach Future (crowd loves this!) but allocate massive resources to bring down its resistant form.
- **Failed Recognition:** Not identifying the asymmetry leads to wasted actions (attacking invulnerable Echo Revenant) and overwhelming threats (mature Chrono-Spawn).

### Teaching the Puzzle:
- Announcer gives hints: "The spawn GROWS with time!" or "The phantom hasn't DIED yet!"
- First attacks on Echo Revenant (Past) should be described dramatically: "Your blade passes through—this is only a MEMORY!"
- Chrono-Spawn's evolution should be viscerally described: "The embryo SWELLS, bones cracking as it GROWS before your eyes!"

## Enemies (Temporal Guardians, exist across all timelines)

### Core Enemies (share HP pool across timelines)
- **Temporal Knight** (CR 5; 100 HP shared; longsword, multiattack, temporal duplicate ability).
  - **Past:** Rusted armor (-1 AC), disadvantage on Dex saves (old joints).
  - **Present:** Standard stats, wields half-finished sword (-1 damage).
  - **Future:** Gleaming armor (+1 AC), advantage on saves vs. magic (enchanted).

- **Chrono Mage** (CR 6; 70 HP shared; *slow*, *haste*, *hold person*, *blink*).
  - **Past:** Ancient robes, disadvantage on initiative (old and slow).
  - **Present:** Standard stats, can cast *time stop* 1/day (only in Present).
  - **Future:** Mastered magic, advantage on concentration checks.

- **Paradox Beast** (CR 7; 120 HP shared; multiattack, temporal bite causes slow effect, phase between timelines).
  - **Past:** Young and reckless, +10 speed but -2 AC.
  - **Present:** Standard stats, can phase to adjacent timeline as bonus action (shifts to Past or Future if available).
  - **Future:** Aged and cunning, +2 AC but -10 speed, advantage on Wisdom saves.

- **2 Temporal Archers** (CR 3 each; 50 HP shared per archer; longbows, rapid shot, temporal step).
  - **Past:** Primitive bows, -1 to attack rolls.
  - **Present:** Standard stats, mobile (Dash as bonus action).
  - **Future:** Advanced bows, +1 to attack rolls, +10 feet range.

### Asymmetric Temporal Enemies (NEW: Strategic Priority Targets)

- **Chrono-Spawn** (CR 6; 90 HP shared; multiattack, temporal evolution).
  - **CRITICAL MECHANIC:** Growing threat—vulnerable in Past, near-invulnerable in Future.
  - **Past:** Embryonic form—AC 12, vulnerable to all damage (takes double damage), slow (20 ft. speed), weak slam attack (1d6).
  - **Present:** Adolescent form—AC 15, standard HP, multiattack (2 claws, 1d8+3 each), 30 ft. speed.
  - **Future:** Fully Matured—AC 18, **resistance to all damage**, regeneration 10 HP/round, multiattack (2 claws, 2d8+4 each), 40 ft. speed, frightful presence (DC 15 Wis save or frightened).
  - **Strategic Implication:** MUST be killed in Past timeline when vulnerable. If it reaches Future, becomes nearly unkillable boss.

- **Echo Revenant** (CR 5; 80 HP shared; spectral attacks, temporal phasing).
  - **CRITICAL MECHANIC:** Fading spirit—invulnerable in Past, vulnerable in Future.
  - **Past:** Not yet dead—**completely immune to all damage** (spectral, intangible), can't attack but repositions freely, moves through walls, 50 ft. fly speed. Taunts: "I have not yet fallen! You fight a memory!"
  - **Present:** Death throes—AC 14, **resistance to physical damage**, can attack (spectral touch 2d8+3 necrotic, DC 14 Con save or frightened), 40 ft. fly speed, begins to manifest.
  - **Future:** Fully corporeal ghost—AC 13, **no resistances/immunities** (vulnerable state), full attacks (spectral touch 2d10+4 necrotic, life drain), 30 ft. fly speed, anchored to timeline (can't phase).
  - **Strategic Implication:** IGNORE in Past (wastes actions), optionally damage in Present, MUST kill in Future when fully vulnerable.

**Flex:** For 4 PCs, remove 1 Temporal Archer and reduce Paradox Beast HP to 90. For 6 PCs, add both Chrono-Spawn and Echo Revenant. For standard 5-6 PCs, include ONE of the asymmetric enemies (Chrono-Spawn for aggressive puzzle, Echo Revenant for patience puzzle).

## Enemy Temporal Tactics
- **Strategic Timeline Defense:** Enemies prioritize defending Past timeline (prevents erasure).
  - Temporal Knight guards Past altar.
  - Chrono Mage casts *slow* to prevent PCs from reaching Past during critical rounds.
  - Paradox Beast phases to Past when bloodied (harder to finish off).

- **Exploitation:** Enemies try to waste PC time in Present/Future:
  - Archers kite in Future (pristine columns provide cover).
  - Chrono Mage uses *blink* in Future to evade damage.
  - Paradox Beast taunts PCs: "You waste time in this timeline! We are eternal!"

- **Asymmetric Enemy Tactics (if included):**
  - **Chrono-Spawn Protection:** Other enemies guard the Chrono-Spawn in Past timeline, knowing it's vulnerable there. Temporal Knight interposes; Chrono Mage casts *sanctuary* on it in Past.
  - **Chrono-Spawn Aggression:** In Future, fully matured Chrono-Spawn becomes primary threat—charges PCs aggressively, uses frightful presence to lock down party.
  - **Echo Revenant Bait:** In Past, intangible Echo Revenant positions itself provocatively to bait PC attacks (wastes actions). Taunts: "Strike me! Your blades pass through time itself!"
  - **Echo Revenant Delay:** In Future, Echo Revenant tries to survive—uses life drain to sustain itself, flies away from PCs, hides behind columns, hoping to outlast PCs' resources.

## Crowd Favor Hooks
- Kill an enemy in the Past (causing erasure across all timelines): +3 [[crowds_favor|Favor]] for temporal mastery.
- Damage the same enemy in all three timelines in consecutive rounds: +2 Favor for persistence.
- Prevent Paradox Beast from phasing to Past (kill it in Present/Future before it escapes): +2 Favor for strategic denial.
- Use environmental feature across timelines (collapse column in Past, use pit in Present, bypass obstacle in Future): +2 Favor for temporal thinking.
- [[panache|Panache]] strike that kills enemy in Past right as timeline shifts: +4 Favor for perfect timing.
- Deduce temporal echo mechanic within first 3 rounds (player insight): +2 Favor for intelligence.
- Light all 3 braziers in Past altar (unlocks bonus—Future chandeliers explode dealing 4d6 radiant in 20-foot radius to enemies): +3 Favor for puzzle-solving.
- **Kill Chrono-Spawn in Past timeline** (before it matures): +4 Favor for strategic wisdom—"They slew the INFANT horror before it could EVOLVE!"
- **Refuse to attack invulnerable Echo Revenant in Past** (recognizing the trap): +2 Favor for tactical restraint—"They understand! Some battles are won by WAITING!"
- **Kill Echo Revenant in Future timeline** (when finally vulnerable): +3 Favor for patience rewarded—"They waited for TIME to make their enemy MORTAL!"
- **Allow Chrono-Spawn to reach Future** (and defeat it anyway): +5 Favor for dramatic challenge—"MADNESS! They let the beast MATURE—and STILL brought it down!"

## Announcer Beats
- **Opening:** "TEMPORAL CRUCIBLE! One battle! Three timelines! Can they grasp the paradox—or be lost in TIME?!"
- **First shift (Past → Present):** "A THOUSAND YEARS IN A HEARTBEAT! Time LEAPS forward!"
- **Present → Future:** "The palace RISES! Behold the GLORY yet to come!"
- **Future → Past:** "Time CIRCLES! The loop closes! All begins AGAIN!"
- **Temporal erasure:** "ERASED FROM HISTORY! The knight falls in the PAST—and VANISHES from all futures! IMPOSSIBLE!"
- **Shared damage reveal:** "WAIT! The wound in the present appears in the future! Time BLEEDS through!"
- **Paradox Beast phase:** "It flees through TIME ITSELF! Chase it across eras!"
- **Puzzle solve (braziers):** "The ancient fires IGNITE! The future chandeliers EXPLODE with light! BRILLIANT!"
- **Chrono-Spawn evolution (Past → Present):** "The SPAWN grows! What was WEAK becomes DANGEROUS!"
- **Chrono-Spawn evolution (Present → Future):** "WITNESS THE FINAL FORM! The creature COMPLETES itself—near INVINCIBLE!"
- **Chrono-Spawn killed in Past:** "GENIUS! They struck when it was VULNERABLE—before time could make it a GOD!"
- **Echo Revenant in Past (PC attacks futilely):** "FUTILE! Their blades pass through MEMORY! It hasn't died YET!"
- **Echo Revenant in Future (becoming solid):** "THERE! The ghost becomes FLESH! Time has made it MORTAL at last!"
- **Echo Revenant killed in Future:** "PATIENCE REWARDED! They waited for TIME to grant them their kill!"
- **Victory:** "They've conquered TIME! Past, present, future—all FALL! The arena witnesses ETERNITY bent!"

## GM Tips
- **Visual Tracking:** Use three mini-maps or VTT layers side-by-side labeled "PAST," "PRESENT," "FUTURE." Show all three simultaneously.
- **HP Tracking:** Keep one shared HP tracker per enemy with notation "(across all timelines)."
- **Timeline Tokens:** Use different colored tokens/borders for same enemy in different timelines (Past = sepia, Present = full color, Future = bright/gleaming).
- **Erasure Drama:** When enemy killed in Past, remove all tokens dramatically—"They fade from existence in Present and Future—never existed!"
- **Player Education:** First round, have NPC announcer or Chrono Mage taunt: "Fool! You damage me in the future—but I still exist in the past! Kill me there, or I endure!"
- **Asymmetric Enemy Tracking (if included):**
  - **Chrono-Spawn Visual:** Use progressively larger tokens—small (Past), medium (Present), large (Future). Mark Future version with "REGEN 10" reminder.
  - **Chrono-Spawn Vulnerability:** Put "VULNERABLE—DOUBLE DAMAGE" note on Past token; "RESISTANCE ALL" on Future token. Make it visually obvious.
  - **Echo Revenant Visual:** Use transparent/ghostly token in Past (can't be targeted), semi-transparent in Present, solid in Future.
  - **Echo Revenant Immunity:** Put "IMMUNE—CAN'T DAMAGE" on Past token. When PCs inevitably try to attack it, narrate dramatically: "Your blade passes through empty air—this is only a memory of what will die."
  - **Strategic Hints:** If players struggle, have announcer drop hints: "The spawn grows stronger with each era—strike it while YOUNG!" or "The phantom has not yet fallen—wait for its DEATH in the future!"
- **Temporal Carryover:** Track environmental changes across timelines visibly:
  - **Collapsed Column (Past):** Becomes rubble pile (Present), cleared debris (Future—no column).
  - **Lit Braziers (Past):** Remain lit in Present, enhance chandelier light in Future.
  - **Created Pit (Past):** Becomes construction hazard (Present), patched floor (Future—DC 12 Perception to notice repair).
  - **Blood Spilled:** Dries darker in Present, cleaned/invisible in Future (but ghosts might appear).
- **Complexity Management:** This is an ADVANCED puzzle—ensure players understand shared HP mechanic by round 3. Use diagrams if needed.
- **Pacing:** Encourage strategic discussion during timeline shifts (12-second warning gives planning window).

## Aftermath Seeds
- **Temporal Scars:** PCs who survived all three timelines gain "Chrono-Touched" trait—occasional déjà vu visions of alternate timelines (DM gives hints about future events 1/session, cryptic).
- **Patron Interest:** Time-obsessed wizard impressed by "temporal stability"—offers contract to retrieve artifact from past era (time travel mission, extremely dangerous).
- **Rumor:** The arena's temporal magic damaged Tarsus's timeline—people report "echoes" of themselves from alternate timelines (doppelgangers with different life choices appearing).
- **Downtime:** Chrono Mage's staff can be claimed—allows wielder to cast *haste* 1/day, but ages them 1 year per use (cosmetic aging, no mechanical effect until extreme overuse).
- **Injury:** PC who died in Present or Future timeline (but not Past—those are permanent erasures) develops "Temporal Instability" after resurrection—occasionally phases translucent for 1d4 seconds (cosmetic, unsettling reminder of their brush with temporal erasure).
- **Legendary Moment:** If PCs killed all enemies in Past timeline (perfect temporal strategy), time scholars request interview for paradox study—gain feat: "Temporal Intuition" (+1 Initiative, advantage on Perception checks to detect time magic).
- **Political:** Arena's time magic violates Tarsus chronomancy laws (forbidden by empire after "The Unraveling" 200 years ago)—magistrates investigate, arena risks closure, PCs subpoenaed as witnesses.
- **Loot:** Temporal Knight's sword exists in all three timelines simultaneously—grants +1 longsword that deals extra 1d6 force damage (temporal strike), once per day can "rewind" attack (reroll attack roll, take better result).
