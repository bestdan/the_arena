# The Crowd is Watching

## Hook
Today's match has a twist: the crowd doesn't just watch—they VOTE. Every 3 rounds, the audience chooses a "blessing" or "curse" to inflict on either the gladiators or their enemies. Play to the crowd, and they'll shower you with advantages. Bore them, and they'll make your lives miserable.

## The Voting Mechanic
Every 3 rounds, the announcer calls for a vote. The crowd's choice depends on TOTAL Crowd's Favor accumulated:

### Positive Favor (5+): Crowd Chooses Blessing
Roll d6:
1. **Rain of Coins**: 2d10 gp scattered—first to grab gets gold
2. **Weapon Drop**: Magic weapon (+1 sword) falls from sky
3. **Healing Wave**: All gladiators regain 2d6 HP
4. **Enemy Exposed**: One enemy has disadvantage on attacks for 2 rounds
5. **Speed Boost**: All gladiators gain +10 speed for 2 rounds
6. **Fan Favorite**: Next Panache roll has advantage

### Neutral Favor (0-4): Crowd Chooses Chaos
Roll d6:
1. **Arena Hazard**: Random 10 ft square becomes fire (2d6 damage on entry)
2. **Sudden Darkness**: 30 ft radius darkness for 1 round
3. **Beast Release**: 1d4 wolves enter from random gate
4. **Floor Collapse**: Random PC makes DC 12 Dex or falls in 10 ft pit
5. **Weapon Slick**: All weapons become slippery—next attack at disadvantage
6. **Double or Nothing**: Next attack that hits deals double damage (both sides)

### Negative Favor (-5 or less): Crowd Chooses Curse
Roll d6:
1. **Boo and Hiss**: All gladiators have disadvantage on attacks for 1 round
2. **Enemy Heal**: Enemies regain 2d6 HP each
3. **Tar Pit**: 15 ft radius difficult terrain under gladiators
4. **Blinding Lights**: Magical spotlights—gladiators blinded for 1 round
5. **Reinforcements**: 2 more enemies enter from gates
6. **Crowd's Champion**: One enemy gains +2 to all attacks for 2 rounds

## Arena Layout
- Standard 50 x 50 ft arena—mostly open
- **Crowd Galleries** on all sides (the voters—describe their reactions)
- **Favor Pillars**: 4 pillars display current Favor count (visible to all)
- **Announcer's Booth**: Elevated platform where votes are called
- **Emergency Gates**: 4 gates for reinforcement spawns

## Enemies
- **1 Gladiator Champion** (Berserker, CR 2)—crowd favorite, starts with 2 Favor points of his own
- **4 Arena Dogs** (Mastiffs, CR 1/8)—trained to attack on crowd cues
- Champion and dogs can ALSO earn Favor (DM tracks separately—affects vote thresholds)

### Enemy Favor Mechanics
If enemies have more Favor than party, shift all vote thresholds up by 2 (need 7+ for blessing instead of 5+).

## Crowd's Favor Opportunities (Enhanced)
- Every Panache roll matters MORE here—this is a crowd-focused fight
- Standard Panache: +1 Favor on success
- Finishing blow with Panache: +2 Favor
- Dramatic failure (nat 1 with flair): +1 Favor anyway (crowd loves tragedy)
- Address the crowd directly (use action to play to them): Persuasion DC 12 for +1 Favor
- Execute a move the crowd "suggested" via last vote: +1 Favor (listening to your fans)

## Scaling
- **3 PCs**: No Champion, 6 Arena Dogs, vote threshold +1 for blessing
- **5 PCs**: Champion has 45 HP, 6 Arena Dogs

## Announcer Beats
- "The CROWD holds your fate! Will they BLESS you—or CURSE you?"
- Before vote: "CITIZENS! Cast your judgment! Do these gladiators DESERVE your favor?"
- Blessing chosen: "The crowd LOVES them! RAIN DOWN, gifts of glory!"
- Curse chosen: "BOOOOO! The crowd has SPOKEN! Suffer, entertainers!"
- If party plays to crowd: "They KNOW who feeds them fame! The galleries ROAR!"

## GM Tips
- Make votes theatrical—describe nobles arguing, commoners chanting
- Track enemy Favor alongside party Favor (simple tally)
- If party is losing badly, have a drunk noble toss them a potion (mercy, but costs 1 Favor)
- Crowd reactions should be visceral—cheers, gasps, thrown objects

## Aftermath Seeds
- High Favor finish = noble patrons approach immediately after match
- Low Favor finish = commoners spit on them as they leave (but guards respect their survival)
- Champion, if spared, becomes bitter rival or unexpected ally depending on party's Favor
- "Crowd voting" becomes optional mechanic for future matches if players enjoyed it
