# The Centrifuge

- **Hook:** "Hold on or be hurled!" The entire arena floor is a massive rotating platform that spins faster each round. Gladiators must fight while maintaining footing, or be flung into spiked walls at lethal velocity. The crowd watches as centrifugal force turns combat into a whirling dance of death.
- **Party:** 4-6 PCs, level 7+. Tests balance, Strength/Athletics, and combat adaptability under rotational physics.

## Arena Layout
- Circular rotating platform (120-foot diameter, 2 feet thick stone disc).
- **Rotation Axis:** Platform rotates around central 10-foot diameter pillar (stationary, 20 feet tall).
- **Spin Speed:** Platform rotates clockwise, speed increases each round.
- **Outer Wall:** 40-foot-high stone wall with inward-facing iron spikes surrounds arena (stationary wall, rotating floor).
- **Anchor Points:** 8 chain anchors bolted to rotating floor (Athletics DC varies to hold on).

## Rotation Mechanic
- **Initiative Count 20:** Platform rotation speed increases.
  - **Round 1-2:** Slow spin (5 ft/sec). Acrobatics/Athletics DC 10 to move normally.
  - **Round 3-4:** Moderate spin (10 ft/sec). DC 13 or be pushed 10 feet toward outer wall per round.
  - **Round 5-6:** Fast spin (15 ft/sec). DC 16 or be pushed 20 feet toward outer wall per round.
  - **Round 7-8:** Dangerous spin (20 ft/sec). DC 19 or be pushed 30 feet toward outer wall per round.
  - **Round 9+:** Lethal spin (25 ft/sec). DC 22 or be pushed 40 feet toward outer wall per round.

## Centrifugal Force Rules
- **Failed Save:** Creature slides outward (toward wall) specified distance; can't control direction.
- **Wall Impact:** Creature slammed into spiked wall takes 4d10 piercing damage and is restrained by spikes (Strength DC 16 to pull free, takes 2d6 piercing damage when freed).
- **Prone Penalty:** Prone creatures have disadvantage on saves vs. centrifugal force.
- **Anchor Points:** Creature can use action to grab chain anchor (Athletics check, DC = current rotation DC); while holding, immune to push but can't attack (one hand occupied, disadvantage on attacks if using weapon).
- **Center Pillar:** Creatures adjacent to central pillar gain advantage on saves vs. centrifugal force (eye of the storm).

## Movement and Combat Adjustments
- **Moving Inward (toward center):** Movement costs double (fighting centrifugal force).
- **Moving Outward (toward wall):** Movement costs half (momentum assists).
- **Ranged Attacks:** Attacks at disadvantage when target is more than 30 feet away (spinning disorientation).
- **Spellcasting Concentration:** Constitution save DC 12 to maintain concentration each round (spinning disrupts focus).

## Enemies (agile and anchored combatants)
- 3 Displacer Beasts (CR 3 each; tentacle attacks have reach, displacement makes them hard to hit, naturally agile on spinning floor).
- 2 Oni (CR 7 each; shapechange to fly form avoids floor, cone of cold from above, regeneration).
- 4 Hook Horrors (CR 3 each; hook claws grab chain anchors, pull PCs off balance, climb instead of slide).
- 1 Adult Bronze Dragon (CR 17; reduced HP to ~150 for balance; flies above floor, lightning breath, repulsion breath pushes PCs toward wall).
- **Flex:** For 4 PCs, remove 1 Displacer Beast, both Oni, and replace Dragon with Young Dragon (CR 8-9). For 6 PCs, upgrade Dragon to full stats and add 2 more Hook Horrors.

## Enemy Tactics
- **Displacer Beasts:** Use tentacles to trip PCs (prone = easier to fling outward); displacement makes them hard to target.
- **Oni:** Fly above rotating floor, use cone of cold to freeze and knock prone; regeneration makes them persistent threats.
- **Hook Horrors:** Anchor themselves with hooks, attack PCs struggling to maintain footing; pull PCs away from center.
- **Bronze Dragon:** Hovers above, uses lightning breath and repulsion breath to blast PCs toward spiked wall; never touches spinning floor.

## Crowd Favor Hooks
- Successfully move to center pillar from outer edge while at fast+ spin speed: +2 [[crowds_favor|Favor]] for determination.
- Defeat enemy while both sliding toward wall: +2 Favor for desperate combat.
- Grapple enemy and release them to be flung into wall: +2 Favor for using environment.
- Never grab an anchor point (fight freely throughout): +3 Favor for mastery.
- Save ally from wall impalement by pulling them free: +2 Favor for heroic rescue.
- Kill the Dragon with melee attack while on spinning floor: +3 Favor for impossible feat.
- Make successful Acrobatics check every round at dangerous+ spin speed: +2 Favor for perfect balance.

## Hazards and Environment
- **Centrifugal Force:** Constant outward push; failure means wall impact and spike damage.
- **Spiked Wall:** 4d10 piercing on impact, restrains victim, ongoing 2d6 when pulled free.
- **Increasing Speed:** Each round gets harder; early confidence becomes late-game desperation.
- **Disorientation:** Spinning causes nausea, disorientation (roleplay vertigo, disadvantage on Perception checks).
- **Anchor Dilemma:** Safety vs. offense—holding anchor means survival but can't fight effectively.

## Announcer Beats
- Opening: "THE FLOOR SPINS! Faster and faster! Will they defy physics—or be HURLED into the spikes?!"
- First push: "He slides! He's SLIDING! Ten feet toward the wall! Grab something!"
- Wall impact: "IMPALED! Spikes pierce flesh! Blood streams! Can she pull free?!"
- Anchor grab: "Clinging to the chain! One-handed now! Brave or desperate?!"
- Speed increase: "FASTER! The platform accelerates! Even standing becomes impossible!"
- Enemy flung: "The Oni loses flight—SLAMS into spikes! Its regeneration won't save it now!"
- Victory: "They stand at the center! The platform slows! Masters of the centrifuge!"

## GM Tips
- Demonstrate rotation speed visually (spinning token on table, rotate map gradually).
- Track rotation DC publicly so PCs know what they're facing each round.
- Remind PCs of movement cost differences (inward vs. outward)—strategic positioning critical.
- Enemies should exploit environment: Dragon blasts PCs outward, Hook Horrors anchor and attack.
- Narrate spinning viscerally: "The world blurs," "Your inner ear screams," "Gravity pulls you sideways."
- If PC hits wall, describe spike impact graphically (respect safety but convey stakes).
- Let creative solutions shine: *spider climb* to walk on wall, *fly* to avoid floor, *reverse gravity*.
- Consider giving exhaustion after 8+ rounds of spinning (severe vertigo, nausea).

## Aftermath Seeds
- Patron interest: Carnival master impressed by "centrifugal survival"; offers job as death-defying performer (fame but risk).
- Rumor: The rotating platform mechanism is dwarven-made, powered by enslaved earth elementals—liberation plot brewing.
- Downtime: Hook Horror hooks can be harvested (crafted into climbing claws with advantage on Athletics checks to climb, smith required, 75 gp).
- Injury: PC impaled on spikes develops "Spike Trauma"—permanent scar, nightmares of spinning, disadvantage on saves vs. fear effects involving spinning/falling.
- Political: Arena engineers praised for innovation but questioned about safety—one noble's son died in private testing.
- Reward: Bronze Dragon scales (can be sold for 500 gp total or crafted into *+1 scale mail* with lightning resistance by master armorer).
