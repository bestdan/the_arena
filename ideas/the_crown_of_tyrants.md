# The Crown of Tyrants

- **Hook:** A cursed golden crown sits on a central pedestal. Whoever wears it gains immense power—but slowly transforms into a tyrant who will betray their allies. Every 3 rounds, the crown MUST be passed to a new wearer or the current bearer becomes permanently hostile. Can they coordinate crown rotations, use its power strategically, and defeat enemies before the curse claims them all?
- **Party:** 3-5 PCs. Tests trust, timing, self-control, and sacrifice. The ultimate "hot potato" with deadly stakes. Players must manage a corrupting power that helps and harms simultaneously.

## Arena Layout

- Octagonal arena (80-foot diameter) with raised central platform (20 feet diameter, 5 feet high).
- **The Pedestal:** Center of platform holds the **Crown of Tyrants** (golden, spiked, radiates dark energy).
- **Eight Pillars:** Positioned around platform perimeter (15 feet tall, provide full cover, climbable DC 10).
- **Crowd Cages:** Four iron cages (10 feet tall, 10×10 feet) suspended from ceiling by chains (15 feet above ground). Each contains 1d4 trapped civilians (non-combatants, used for dramatic leverage by enemies).
- **Corruption Pools:** Three pools of black liquid (10-foot diameter) scattered on arena floor. Stepping in = 1d6 necrotic damage per round, feeds crown's power.
- **No Exits:** Arena is sealed—only way out is defeating all enemies or succumbing to crown's curse (in which case, PCs fight each other to death—crowd wins either way).

## The Crown of Tyrants Mechanic (CORE CHALLENGE)

**Anyone can wear the crown (donning = bonus action, removing = action).**

### Crown Benefits (While Worn):
- **+3 bonus to all attack rolls and damage rolls.**
- **AC +2 (magical force field).**
- **Advantage on Strength and Charisma checks/saves.**
- **Immunity to being charmed or frightened.**
- **Command Aura:** Once per turn (bonus action), force one creature within 30 feet to make DC 15 Wisdom save or be charmed for 1 round (obeys your commands on their next turn).
- **Tyrant's Wrath:** Once per crown rotation, cast *lightning bolt* (8d6, DC 15 Dex save) as bonus action.

### Crown Corruption (Escalating Each Round Worn):
- **Round 1 Wearing Crown:** Whispers of power—no mechanical effect, just unsettling narration.
- **Round 2:** Paranoia sets in—disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws, PC must make DC 12 Charisma save or become hostile to nearest ally (attacks them on their next turn, then regains control).
- **Round 3:** CRITICAL—PC must pass crown to another PC (action to remove, bonus action for ally to don) OR become **Permanently Hostile** (DM controls PC, they fight to kill allies, only *remove curse* or crown destruction can save them).
- **Round 4+:** If still wearing (didn't pass on round 3), PC is LOST—becomes NPC villain permanently (even if combat ends). Party must kill them or abandon them.

### Crown Rotation Rules:
- **MUST rotate every 3 rounds** to avoid permanent corruption.
- Rotation requires:
  1. Current wearer uses ACTION to remove crown (provokes opportunity attacks).
  2. New wearer must be within 5 feet and use BONUS ACTION to don it.
  3. Corruption timer resets to Round 1 for new wearer.
- **Strategic Tension:** Removing crown costs action economy; PCs lose powerful buffs during rotation round.
- **Enemies will target rotating PCs** to disrupt process or kill defenseless crown-bearer.

## Enemies (Tyrant's Servants, test crown management)

### 3 PCs:
- 4 **Thrall Warriors** (CR 1/2; former gladiators, commanded by crown's previous victims, basic melee).
- 2 **Betrayer Knights** (CR 3; heavily armored, multiattack, attempt to grapple PCs during crown rotation).
- 1 **Crown Cultist** (CR 5; spellcaster, *dispel magic* to try removing crown mid-combat, *hold person* to prevent rotations, worships the corruption).

### 4-5 PCs:
- 6 Thrall Warriors.
- 3 Betrayer Knights.
- 2 Crown Cultists.
- 1 **Tyrant Remnant** (CR 7; former crown victim, now undead, regeneration 10 HP/round unless crown is worn by PC—creating dilemma: wear crown to weaken boss BUT risk corruption).

### Enemy Tactics:
- **Thrall Warriors:** Swarm non-crown-wearing PCs, try to separate team.
- **Betrayer Knights:** Focus on grappling crown-bearer during round 3 (rotation round) to prevent passing.
- **Crown Cultists:** Cast *hold person* on PCs about to receive crown, *dispel magic* on crown buffs, heal Tyrant Remnant.
- **Tyrant Remnant:** Targets crown-wearer specifically, taunts them: "Feel the power! Why share it? TAKE IT ALL!" (tries to manipulate them into keeping crown beyond round 3).

## Rotation Coordination Challenges

**Communication:**
- PCs must track who wore crown when, how many rounds each person has left.
- Use physical tokens or verbal countdown: "I'm on round 2—need to pass NEXT turn!"

**Positioning:**
- New wearer must be within 5 feet during rotation round.
- Enemies will try to separate PCs or create barriers.
- Opportunity attacks during crown removal = significant risk.

**Sacrifice:**
- Wearing crown = powerful but dangerous.
- Some PCs may need to wear it multiple times (if team is small).
- Risk of permanent loss increases with each rotation.

## Civilian Hostage Complication

**Four Cages with Civilians:**
- Tyrant Remnant threatens: "Let one of you keep the crown for 5 rounds, and I release ALL hostages. Refuse, and I drop one cage every 2 rounds."
- **Dropped Cage:** Falls 15 feet, civilians take 5d6 bludgeoning, likely die (DC 15 Dex save for half).
- **Dilemma:** PCs must choose—sacrifice one PC to permanent corruption to save civilians, or let innocents die to preserve team.
- **Cage Release:** Chains have locks (DC 18 Thieves' Tools or AC 15, 30 HP to break). Releasing civilians mid-combat costs actions but saves lives.

**Crowd Favor Mechanic:**
- Saving civilians = major Favor.
- Letting them die = crowd boos, lose Favor.
- Accepting Tyrant Remnant's deal = crowd ROARS approval (dramatic sacrifice), massive Favor—but one PC likely lost forever.

## Objectives

- **Primary:** Defeat all enemies without any PC succumbing to permanent crown corruption.
- **Secondary:** Save at least 3 civilian cages from falling.
- **Bonus:** Destroy the crown after victory (AC 20, 100 HP, immunity to non-magical damage; requires powerful attacks or *dispel magic* DC 18) to prevent future corruption—crowd respects this but loses a spectacle tool.

## Crowd Favor Hooks

- Successfully rotate crown 3+ times without anyone failing saves: +3 [[crowds_favor|Favor]] for discipline.
- Use Tyrant's Wrath (*lightning bolt*) to kill 2+ enemies simultaneously: +2 Favor for power.
- Wear crown for 2 rounds, resist paranoia (pass Charisma save), then pass it safely: +2 Favor for self-control.
- PC voluntarily wears crown knowing they'll hit round 3 to buy time for rotation: +3 Favor for sacrifice.
- Save all 4 civilian cages: +4 Favor for heroism.
- Refuse Tyrant Remnant's hostage deal and still save civilians: +5 Favor for defiance.
- Accept hostage deal (one PC corrupts permanently) to save civilians: +6 Favor for ultimate sacrifice (corrupted PC becomes legendary martyr).
- Kill Tyrant Remnant while wearing crown (using its power against it): +2 Favor for irony.
- [[panache|Panache]] declare final crown rotation ("This is MY burden now!") and succeed: +3 Favor for drama.
- Destroy crown after victory: +2 Favor for ending curse.

## Announcer Beats

- Opening: "THE CROWN OF TYRANTS! Power beyond measure! Corruption beyond redemption! Who will DARE to wear it?!"
- First crown donned: "They take the crown! Power SURGES! But the whispers begin..."
- Round 2 corruption: "The crown TIGHTENS! Paranoia! Can they resist?!"
- First successful rotation: "They PASS it! Wisdom over greed! The curse RESETS!"
- Failed rotation (PC attacks ally): "NO! Betrayal! The crown CLAIMS their mind!"
- Hostage threat: "The Tyrant offers a DEAL! One hero's soul for innocent lives! What will they CHOOSE?!"
- Cage dropped: "THE CAGE FALLS! Screams echo! Blood on their hands!"
- Permanent corruption: "LOST! The crown WINS! They are TYRANT now! Former allies must face them!"
- Victory without corruption: "They've CONQUERED the curse! Power wielded, then DISCARDED! True champions!"
- Crown destroyed: "THE CROWN SHATTERS! The curse ENDS! They've freed Tarsus from its shadow!"

## GM Tips

- **Visible Timer:** Use index cards or tokens to track each PC's "crown rounds"—flip/move them publicly so everyone knows status.
- **Paranoia Roleplay:** When PC fails Charisma save (round 2), have THEM describe their sudden hostility: "I see you reaching for MY crown..." 
- **Rotation Urgency:** Count down audibly: "You're on round 2. Next turn, you MUST pass it or save."
- **NPC Corruption Example:** Start combat with NPC ally wearing crown (already on round 3). Have them FAIL to pass it, become hostile—demonstrates stakes immediately.
- **Hostage Pressure:** Drop first cage early (round 4) to prove threat is real; guilt-trip PCs effectively.
- **Enemy Interference:** Betrayer Knights should ALWAYS try to grapple during rotation rounds—create dramatic struggles.
- **Crown Destruction:** If PCs destroy crown, have Tyrant Remnant scream and weaken (lose regeneration, disadvantage on attacks)—reward the choice mechanically.
- **Permanent Loss Handling:** If PC becomes permanently corrupted, offer player chance to roll new character OR control corrupted version as villain in future session (dramatic callback).

## Tactical Elements

- **Power Spikes:** Crown-wearer is significantly stronger—team should focus enemy attention on them while they have buffs.
- **Rotation Vulnerability:** Round 3 is dangerous—team must protect rotating PCs (readied actions, defensive positioning).
- **Command Aura Abuse:** Use crown's charm ability to turn enemies against each other or control them for 1 round (massive tactical advantage).
- **Tyrant Remnant Counter:** If NO ONE wears crown, Tyrant Remnant regenerates unchecked—SOMEONE must wear it to weaken boss.
- **Civilian Calculations:** Each cage rescue costs ~2 actions (climb/lockpick OR attack chains)—team must balance offense vs. rescue.

## Aftermath Seeds

- **Crown Fragment:** If crown destroyed, each PC can claim a shard—grants +1 to one ability score permanently BUT minor paranoia flaw (disadvantage on Insight checks vs. allies for first hour after long rest).
- **Corrupted PC Fate:** If PC permanently corrupted, they become recurring villain NPC—hunts former party, arena uses them as future boss fight.
- **Patron Interest:** Wizard fascinated by crown's enchantment—offers to study PC who wore it longest (3+ rotations) for 500 gp; PC must endure 1 week of tests (painful but harmless).
- **Rumor:** Crown was forged by ancient tyrant-king who conquered Tarsus 1,000 years ago—his descendants seek its return (or destruction), creating faction quest.
- **Downtime:** PC who resisted round 2 paranoia 2+ times gains "Iron Will" training—advantage on Charisma saves vs. possession/corruption for 1 month.
- **Injury:** PC who wore crown 4+ total rounds (across multiple rotations) develops "Tyrant's Echo" scar—eyes occasionally flash gold when angry (cosmetic, unsettling).
- **Legendary Moment:** If team saved all civilians AND destroyed crown, ballads sung in their honor; gain "Heroes of Tarsus" reputation (+5 to Persuasion checks in city for 1 month).
- **Political:** Crown's destruction angers arena's secret benefactor (nobleman who profited from corruption spectacle)—he becomes enemy NPC, sabotages future bouts.
- **Civilian Gratitude:** Saved hostages are merchants—offer 50% discount at shops for 1 week, spread positive rumors about PCs.
- **Loot:** Betrayer Knights drop **Traitor's Blade** (+1 longsword, deals extra 1d6 damage to creatures that trust you—mechanically, creatures you've aided in last 24 hours—cursed item).
