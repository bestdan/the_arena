# Mirror Maze Murders

- **Hook:** A labyrinth of enchanted mirrors confounds friend and foe alike. Reflections lie, doubles attack, and the crowd watches from above as gladiators hunt phantoms. Patrons wager on who breaks first—mind or mirror.
- **Party:** 4-6 PCs, level 5+. Emphasize perception, paranoia, and creative problem-solving.

## Arena Layout
- Circular maze (80-foot diameter) with walls made of 10-foot-tall enchanted mirrors (AC 13, 15 HP per 5-foot section, shatter loudly when broken).
- Three concentric rings of mirrored corridors (5 feet wide); four radial "spokes" connect rings to central chamber (20-foot diameter).
- Central chamber contains the **Mirror Nexus** (glowing crystal pillar, 10 feet tall)—destroying it (AC 15, 50 HP) ends all illusions but triggers final trap.
- Overhead: Crowd watches via suspended scry-orbs; gladiators see only reflections and endless corridors.

## Mirror Mechanics
- **False Reflections:** Mirrors show delayed or duplicated movements (Perception DC 14 to distinguish real from reflection).
- **Mirror Doubles:** Every 3 rounds (initiative count 15), mirrors spawn 1d3 illusory doubles of random PCs in nearby corridors (use PC stats but 1 HP; disappear when hit or when source mirror breaks).
- **Disorientation:** At the start of each PC's turn while in a corridor, roll Wisdom save DC 12 or be disoriented (disadvantage on attack rolls until end of turn).
- **Shatter Effect:** Breaking a mirror creates 10-foot-radius difficult terrain (glass shards) and alerts all enemies to that location.

## Enemies (hidden hunters)
- 3 Doppelgangers (CR 3; mimic PCs, use *detect thoughts* to taunt with personal info, ambush from mirror angles).
- 4 Mirror Wraiths (reskin Shadows with reflective immunity—can only be hit while a PC is adjacent to a mirror; otherwise attacks pass through harmlessly).
- 1 Arcane Illusionist (use Mage; casts *mirror image*, *hypnotic pattern*, *phantasmal force*; hides in central chamber near Nexus).
- **Flex:** For 4 PCs, remove 1 Doppelganger and 1 Mirror Wraith. For 6 PCs, add 1 Invisible Stalker (CR 6) that hunts via scent (ignores mirror illusions).

## Tactical Elements
- **Breaking Mirrors:** Reduces illusion spawn points but creates noise and difficult terrain (double-edged sword).
- **Mirror Wraith Weakness:** Can only be damaged when a PC is adjacent to a mirror (reflective anchoring). Smart PCs lure them near mirrors.
- **Doppelganger Deception:** Use *detect thoughts* to impersonate PCs' dead allies, childhood friends, or deepest fears (Insight DC 15 to detect).
- **Nexus Gambit:** Destroying the central Nexus ends all illusions but triggers **Glass Storm** (see below).

## Glass Storm (Nexus Destruction Trap)
- When Nexus is destroyed, all remaining mirrors explode simultaneously (entire maze becomes difficult terrain, 4d6 slashing damage to all creatures, Dex save DC 15 for half).
- All Mirror Wraiths and illusory doubles vanish instantly.
- Maze becomes open pit (easy navigation, no cover).

## Crowd Favor Hooks
- Identify and strike a Doppelganger's true form (not a reflection): +2 Favor.
- Kill a Mirror Wraith while standing adjacent to a mirror: +1 Favor for understanding the mechanic.
- Survive disorientation and land three consecutive hits: +1 Favor for focus.
- Destroy the Mirror Nexus deliberately to end illusions (despite Glass Storm risk): +2 Favor for boldness.
- Navigate the entire maze without breaking a single mirror: +2 Favor for restraint.
- Use a mirror to redirect an enemy's attack into another enemy: +1 Favor for creativity.

## Hazards and Traps
- **Disorientation Save:** Wisdom DC 12 at start of turn in corridors; failure = disadvantage on attacks.
- **False Paths:** Some mirror walls are illusory (walk through them); others are solid. Trial and error required.
- **Shattered Glass:** Difficult terrain, 1d4 slashing damage if moving more than half speed through it.
- **Mirror Doubles:** Illusory PCs with 1 HP; attack allies, creating friendly-fire chaos.

## Announcer Beats
- Opening: "Behold the Mirror Maze! Truth fractures! Reflections betray! Who will trust their eyes—and who will shatter under the strain?"
- First mirror breaks: "Glass explodes! A corridor revealed! But was it wise—or reckless?"
- Doppelganger reveal: "A duplicate! No—TWO duplicates! Which one bleeds?!"
- Nexus destruction: "THE NEXUS SHATTERS! GLASS STORM ERUPTS! Chaos reigns!"
- Victory: "They emerge from the labyrinth, bloodied but unbroken! The mirrors lie in ruins! Tarsus roars!"

## GM Tips
- Use a simple hand-drawn map with fog-of-war; reveal corridors as PCs explore.
- Pre-assign which PCs get mirror doubles each spawn; describe them in creepy detail.
- Let Doppelgangers roleplay: "Remember when you failed your brother? I remember." (Use *detect thoughts* flavor.)
- If a PC breaks many mirrors, have the Illusionist mock them: "All that noise! How crude!"
- Track Mirror Wraiths carefully; only damage them when PCs are adjacent to intact mirrors.
- Make the Nexus destruction a tough choice: end illusions but face massive damage.

## Aftermath Seeds
- Patron interest: Espionage guild impressed by PC's ability to detect deception; offers contract for infiltration work.
- Rumor: The Doppelgangers were escaped prisoners from a planar jail; more may be loose in Tarsus.
- Downtime: Shattered Nexus crystal shards can be sold (50 gp each, 2d4 shards) or crafted into *mirror of the past* (shows visions of previous owners, 1/day).
- Injury: PC who fought their own Doppelganger develops paranoia (disadvantage on Insight checks vs. disguised creatures for 1d4 days).
- Political: Mirror manufacturer furious about destroyed product; demands compensation or threatens to withdraw arena sponsorship.
