# Aerial Ascension

- **Hook:** Floating platforms rise and fall above a bottomless pit. Wings, ropes, and sheer audacity are the only paths to victory. The crowd gasps as combatants leap between islands in the sky. Fall, and the darkness swallows you whole.
- **Party:** 4-6 PCs, level 6+. Flight, mobility spells, and verticality tactics are key. Ground-bound fighters must adapt or perish.

## Arena Layout
- **The Void:** Bottomless pit (visibly dark, no bottom seen even with darkvision). Fall = death (no save, instant elimination).
- **Floating Platforms:** 12 circular platforms (15-foot diameter each) hover at varying heights (20-60 feet above the pit floor).
- Platforms rise and fall slowly (10 feet per round, cyclical pattern). GM tracks platform heights on a simple chart.
- **Jump Distances:** Adjacent platforms are 10-20 feet apart horizontally; vertical gaps vary by 0-30 feet depending on rise/fall cycle.
- **Chains and Ropes:** Hanging between some platforms (Athletics DC 12 to swing, DC 15 to climb). Can be cut (AC 10, 5 HP).

## Platform Rise/Fall Mechanic
- At initiative count 20 (losing ties), all platforms shift 10 feet (half rise, half fall, determined by pre-set pattern or DM choice).
- **Low Platforms** (20 feet): Easy to reach from neighbors, but vulnerable to ground-based hazards (see Void Spawn).
- **Mid Platforms** (40 feet): Central tier, most tactically stable.
- **High Platforms** (60 feet): Hard to reach, but safest from ground threats. Risk falling farther.

## Enemies (sky hunters)
- 3 Aarakocra Sky Reavers (CR 1/4 but buffed to 30 HP each; flyby attacks, talons and javelins, 50-foot fly speed).
- 2 Gargoyles (CR 2; false appearance when perched on platforms, fly 60 feet, stone camouflage).
- 1 Wyvern Rider (Wyvern CR 6 with Bandit Captain CR 2 rider; strafing runs, poison sting, 80-foot fly speed).
- 2 Air Elemental Spawn (reskin Dust Mephits to CR 1; gust of wind pushes PCs off platforms, fly 30 feet).
- **Flex:** For 4 PCs, remove 1 Aarakocra and both Air Elemental Spawn. For 6 PCs, add 1 more Gargoyle and upgrade Wyvern Rider's mount to Young Dragon (Bronze or Copper, CR 6-7).

## Void Spawn (Environmental Threat)
- At the end of rounds 4 and 7, a **Void Tendril** (reskin Grick, CR 2) emerges from the darkness and attacks the lowest platform (grapple and pull creatures downward, Strength DC 14 to escape).
- If a platform drops below 15 feet, Void Tendrils can reach it (extended range).
- Killing a Tendril earns +1 [[crowds_favor_mechanic|Crowd's Favor]].

## Jumping and Falling Rules
- **Long Jump:** Base distance = Strength score (10-foot running start). Without running start, half distance.
- **High Jump:** 3 + Strength modifier (vertical). Running start not required but grants advantage on Athletics check to grab ledge.
- **Falling:** Fall more than 10 feet off a platform = plummet into Void (death). Allies can attempt to catch/grab (reaction, Athletics DC 15, must be within 5 feet of falling creature).
- **Ledge Catch:** If a PC fails a jump, they can attempt to catch the edge (Dex save DC 13) and hang (use action to climb up, Athletics DC 12).

## Crowd Favor Hooks
- Make a daring leap (20+ feet, vertical or horizontal) and land successfully: +1 Favor.
- Knock an enemy off a platform (shove, spell, etc.): +2 Favor per enemy.
- Catch an ally mid-fall (reaction, Athletics DC 15): +2 Favor to both.
- Kill an enemy while both of you are airborne (mid-jump or fly): +2 Favor for spectacle.
- Swing on a chain to move between platforms dramatically: +1 Favor.
- Defeat the Wyvern Rider while standing on the highest platform: +3 Favor for dominance.

## Tactical Elements
- **Flight Advantage:** PCs with *fly*, *levitate*, or racial flight trivialize vertical gaps but become priority targets.
- **Grounded Tactics:** Non-fliers must rely on chains, Athletics checks, and careful platform timing.
- **Pushing Enemies:** Shove action or spells like *thunderwave*, *gust of wind* become lethal near platform edges.
- **Platform Control:** Enemies prioritize knocking PCs off; PCs should control high platforms for safety.

## Hazards and Environment
- **Void Tendrils:** Grapple from below; pull victims into darkness (death). Focus fire to eliminate.
- **Platform Shifts:** Plan jumps around rise/fall cycle; a platform might be too low/high next round.
- **Chain Cuts:** Enemies may cut chains to isolate PCs; rope-dependent PCs at risk.
- **Wind Gusts:** Air Elemental Spawn use *gust of wind* (Strength save DC 12 or be pushed 15 feet, potentially off platform).

## Announcer Beats
- Opening: "BEHOLD AERIAL ASCENSION! The void yawns! The platforms dance! Will they soar—or fall into eternal night?!"
- First platform shift: "The islands rise and fall! Footing betrays! Leap or die!"
- Enemy knocked off: "THE GARGOYLE PLUMMETS! The crowd watches it vanish into blackness! RUTHLESS!"
- Void Tendril emerges: "TENTACLES FROM BELOW! The abyss hungers! Climb, climb, CLIMB!"
- Daring jump: "A twenty-foot leap! Graceful! Deadly! The crowd holds its breath—HE LANDS!"
- Victory: "They stand triumphant above the void! The sky is theirs! Tarsus erupts!"

## GM Tips
- Use tokens or dice to track platform heights visually; show PCs the pattern so they can plan.
- Remind PCs of jump distances before they commit; falling = death, no mercy.
- Encourage creative uses of spells: *feather fall*, *misty step*, *dimension door*, *fly*.
- Narrate near-misses and ledge catches cinematically: "Your fingers scrape stone! You dangle! Can you pull up?!"
- Let enemies use environment: Aarakocra shove in flyby, Gargoyles perch and ambush, Wyvern strafes low platforms.
- If a PC falls, describe the Void swallowing them—make it horrifying for dramatic stakes.

## Aftermath Seeds
- Patron interest: Sky merchant cartel impressed by aerial tactics; offers flying mount (griffon, hippogriff) or *winged boots*.
- Rumor: The Void beneath the arena is a tear to the Shadowfell; cultists plot to widen it.
- Downtime: Wyvern stinger can be harvested (100 gp value, or crafted into poison vials by alchemist).
- Injury: PC who caught an ally mid-fall develops "Sky Bond" with that ally—mechanical bonus (advantage on saves to catch them again) or narrative trust deepens.
- Political: Arena engineers questioned about Void Tendrils—were they intentional, or did something escape containment?
