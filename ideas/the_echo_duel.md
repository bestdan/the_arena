# The Echo Duel

## Hook
A mysterious mirror has been wheeled into the arena. Every action the gladiators take is repeated by their **Echo**—a shadowy duplicate that appears 1 round later and mimics exactly what they did. The party must fight enemies while managing the chaos of their own past actions attacking alongside them... or against them.

## Echo Mechanics

### Echo Creation
- At the end of each PC's turn, record what they did (movement, actions, bonus actions)
- At the START of their NEXT turn, their Echo appears at their previous position and repeats that exact sequence
- Echoes last only 1 round (until they complete the mimicked actions)

### Echo Properties
- Echoes have the same AC and attack bonuses as the PC
- Echoes deal half damage (they're not fully real)
- Echoes cannot be targeted—they're intangible until they attack
- Echo attacks CAN hit enemies (helpful) OR allies (if ally moved into the path)

### Tactical Implications
- If you attacked north last round, your Echo attacks north THIS round—even if your enemy moved
- If you healed an ally, your Echo heals whoever is NOW in that position
- Movement is replayed exactly—if you dashed 30 ft east, Echo dashes 30 ft east from your old position

## The Mirror
- 10 ft tall obsidian mirror at arena center
- Looking into it reveals your NEXT action (cryptic vision—DC 14 Insight to interpret)
- Destroying the mirror (AC 13, 50 HP) ends all echoes but releases a **Mirror Wraith** (see below)

## Arena Layout
- 50 x 50 ft arena with mirror at center
- Four pillars (corners)—can block Echo movement if placed correctly
- **Reflection Pools**: Three shallow pools reflect the mirror—standing in them makes your Echo appear HERE instead of your old position (tactical repositioning)
- Walls are mirrored—disorienting, disadvantage on Perception checks

## Enemies
- **2 Shadow Dancers** (use Shadow stats, CR 1/2 but with 20 HP)—also create Echoes, but theirs are REVERSED (appear 1 round BEFORE they act, telegraphing moves)
- **1 Mirror Knight** (use Knight stats, CR 3)—immune to Echo damage, can attack Echoes to "absorb" them (+1d6 to next attack per Echo absorbed)
- **Mirror Wraith** (Specter, CR 1)—only appears if mirror is destroyed

### Enemy Echo Telegraphing
- Shadow Dancers' echoes appear BEFORE they act
- Smart players can read the Echo to know where the Shadow Dancer will move/attack
- Creates cat-and-mouse dynamic

## Crowd's Favor Opportunities
- Set up Echo to hit enemy perfectly (plan 1 round ahead): +2 Favor
- Panache when your Echo does something dramatic
- Accidentally hit ally with Echo, then save them same round: +1 Favor (crowd loves chaos)
- Destroy mirror dramatically: Panache roll (but releases Wraith)
- Read Shadow Dancer's echo and counter-attack: +1 Favor

## Puzzle Element
- The mirror shows cryptic visions of future actions
- If a PC looks into mirror (action), DM describes what they'll do next round in riddle form
- Correct interpretation (DC 14 Insight) = that PC can choose to CANCEL their Echo next round (prevent accidents)

## Scaling
- **3 PCs**: 1 Shadow Dancer, Mirror Knight has 40 HP
- **5 PCs**: 3 Shadow Dancers, add 1 more Mirror Knight

## Announcer Beats
- "Every action has a CONSEQUENCE! Your past returns to HAUNT you!"
- First Echo appears: "There they are! ECHOES of glory past—or MISTAKES yet realized!"
- Echo hits enemy: "The PAST serves the PRESENT! Magnificent timing!"
- Echo hits ally: "OH NO! Their own shadow BETRAYS them! Plan AHEAD, gladiators!"
- Mirror destroyed: "The glass SHATTERS! But what lurks WITHIN?"

## GM Tips
- Track Echoes on paper: PC name, position at end of turn, actions taken
- Use tokens or different colored minis for Echoes
- Keep pace quick—Echoes should feel chaotic, not bogged down
- If players are overwhelmed, have the Mirror Knight absorb Echoes (reduces chaos, powers up boss)

## Aftermath Seeds
- Mirror fragments worth 25 gp each—but buyers include shady seers
- Shadow Dancer essence can be bottled—creates "Shadow Ink" for invisible writing
- If Mirror Wraith is spared (it flees at 10 HP), it may return as an unlikely informant
- "Echo combat" could become optional mechanic for future matches against specific patrons
