# The Architect's Test

- **Hook:** The arena is a three-dimensional puzzle box—walls that slide, floors that rotate, bridges that extend. An architect's ghost watches from the shadows, testing those who dare navigate their masterwork. Solve the spatial puzzles to unlock the path to the exit, all while mechanical guardians and collapsing sections punish hesitation. Think fast, move faster, or be entombed in stone forever.
- **Party:** 4-6 PCs, level 5+. Emphasize spatial reasoning, teamwork, and adapting to dynamic environments under time pressure.

## Arena Layout
- Multi-level arena (100x100 feet, three vertical levels: Ground, Middle Platform, Upper Cauldron) connected by **moveable bridges and rotating sections**.
- **Ground Level:** Four quadrants divided by sliding walls (20-foot-tall stone barriers that move horizontally along tracks).
- **Middle Platform:** 30 feet above ground; accessible via extending bridges or climbing; contains **3 Pressure Plates**.
- **Upper Platform:** 50 feet above ground; contains the **Exit Portal** (glowing archway; initially locked).
- **Control Pylons:** 4 pylons (one per ground quadrant) that control bridges, walls, and rotations.
- Terrain: shifting stone blocks (create/remove cover dynamically), retractable stairs, rotating floor sections.
- Crowd watches from transparent dome above (they can see the entire puzzle from above; PCs only see their level).

## Core Mechanic: Spatial Puzzle Solving
The arena is a **mechanical puzzle** controlled by **4 Control Pylons** on the ground level. PCs must manipulate the environment to create a path to the Upper Platform's Exit Portal.

### Control Pylons
Each pylon is a **stone obelisk** (5 feet tall, glowing runes, AC 15, 40 HP) with an **interaction panel** (requires 1 action to activate).

**Pylon Functions:**
1. **North Pylon (Red Runes):** Extends/retracts **North Bridge** (connects ground to Middle Platform).
2. **South Pylon (Blue Runes):** Rotates **South Floor Section** (90 degrees clockwise; changes connections between ground quadrants).
3. **East Pylon (Green Runes):** Slides **East Wall** (blocks or opens passage between ground quadrants).
4. **West Pylon (Yellow Runes):** Extends/retracts **West Stairs** (connects Middle Platform to Upper Platform).

### Pressure Plates
The **Middle Platform** contains **3 Pressure Plates** (marked with glowing symbols: circle, square, triangle).
- All three plates must be **simultaneously activated** (weight of at least 100 lbs on each) to unlock the **Upper Platform Exit Portal**.
- Plates can be held down by PCs, heavy objects (crates, barrels scattered on Middle Platform), or defeated enemy corpses.
- If any plate is released, Exit Portal re-locks (progress resets).

### Puzzle Solution Path
1. **Ground Level:** PCs must activate **North Pylon** (extend bridge to Middle Platform) and manipulate **South Pylon** (rotate floor to align quadrants for easier navigation) while avoiding sliding walls (East/West Pylons).
2. **Middle Platform:** PCs must position themselves or objects on all 3 Pressure Plates simultaneously.
3. **Middle to Upper:** Once Exit Portal unlocks, PCs must activate **West Pylon** (extend stairs) and ascend to Exit Portal.
4. **Exit Portal:** One PC must step through portal to trigger victory (all PCs pulled through automatically via magical teleportation).

### Time Pressure
- **Round 12:** Arena begins **collapsing** (see Hazards). Sections crumble; bridges fail; pylons malfunction.
- PCs must solve the puzzle and reach the Exit Portal before the arena self-destructs.

## Enemies (Mechanical Guardians)
Clockwork constructs activated when PCs interact with Control Pylons. They **interfere with puzzle-solving** by attacking PCs, destroying objects, or sabotaging pylon activations.

### 4 PCs
- 4 **Clockwork Sentries** (use Animated Armor, CR 1; patrol ground level; attack PCs near pylons).
- 2 **Gear Golems** (use Helmed Horror, CR 4; stationed on Middle Platform; guard Pressure Plates).

### 5 PCs
- 5 Clockwork Sentries.
- 3 Gear Golems.
- Add 2 **Repair Drones** (use Flying Sword, CR 1/4; fly around arena; attempt to "fix" pylon activations by reversing them—e.g., retract extended bridge).

### 6 PCs
- 6 Clockwork Sentries.
- 4 Gear Golems.
- 3 Repair Drones.
- Add 1 **Architect's Phantom** (use Banshee, CR 4; reduced HP to 40; ghostly figure of the arena's creator; wails to frighten PCs, disrupting concentration on puzzle-solving).

### Enemy Tactics
- **Clockwork Sentries** patrol ground level; attack PCs who activate pylons (try to interrupt pylon interactions).
- **Gear Golems** guard Middle Platform; push PCs off Pressure Plates (Shove action) or stand on plates themselves (blocking PC access).
- **Repair Drones** (if present) fly to recently activated pylons and "repair" them (reverse the activation—e.g., retract a bridge, rotate floor back, slide wall closed). Can be destroyed to prevent interference.
- **Architect's Phantom** (if present) wails periodically (Frightful Wail; Wisdom save DC 13 or frightened for 1 minute; frightened PCs hesitate, disrupting teamwork).

## Objectives
- **Primary:** Activate the 4 Control Pylons in the correct sequence to create a path from Ground Level to Upper Platform.
- **Secondary:** Simultaneously activate all 3 Pressure Plates on the Middle Platform to unlock the Exit Portal.
- **Tertiary:** Reach the Exit Portal and escape before Round 12 (collapsing arena).
- **Bonus:** Complete puzzle without destroying any pylons (some PCs may want to smash pylons in frustration; discourage this by making puzzle unsolvable if pylons are destroyed).

## Tactical Elements
- **Pylon Sequencing:** PCs must determine which pylons to activate and in what order (e.g., extend bridge first, then rotate floor, then slide wall, then extend stairs).
- **Pressure Plate Coordination:** Requires at least 3 PCs (or PCs + heavy objects) to stand on plates simultaneously. PCs must communicate and coordinate timing.
- **Vertical Movement:** Climbing, flying, or jumping may bypass some puzzle elements but still requires unlocking Exit Portal (plates must be activated).
- **Repair Drone Sabotage:** If Repair Drones are present, PCs must prioritize destroying them or blocking their access to pylons.
- **Guardian Interference:** Clockwork Sentries and Gear Golems disrupt puzzle-solving; PCs must fight while thinking (multitasking challenge).
- **Object Utilization:** Heavy objects (crates, barrels, enemy corpses) can hold Pressure Plates, freeing PCs to ascend stairs.

## Hazards and Twists
- **Sliding Walls:** East and West Pylons control walls that slide horizontally. If a PC is between wall and stationary surface when wall slides, they take 3d6 bludgeoning damage and are restrained (Athletics DC 14 to escape).
- **Rotating Floor:** South Pylon rotates a 30x30 floor section 90 degrees. PCs standing on rotating section must make Dex save DC 12 or fall prone (disorienting; disadvantage on next attack/ability check).
- **Retracting Bridges:** If North or West Pylon is deactivated (by Repair Drone or PC mistake), bridges retract. PCs on bridge when it retracts must make Dex save DC 15 or fall (30 feet to ground or 50 feet from Upper Platform; 3d6 or 5d6 bludgeoning damage).
- **Collapsing Arena (Round 12+):** Arena self-destructs. Each round, 1d4 random 10x10 sections crumble (Dex save DC 15 or fall through; 3d6 bludgeoning + trapped in rubble). Pylons malfunction (50% chance pylon reverses activation each round). Exit Portal flickers (if plates not held, portal closes permanently after Round 15).
- **False Pylon (Optional):** One pylon (randomly determined) is a **decoy**—activating it does nothing (wastes action). Arcana DC 14 to identify decoy.
- **Round 8 Twist:** Architect's Phantom appears (if not already present) and speaks: "Only the CLEVER escape my maze! Prove your worth!" (psychological pressure; no mechanical effect unless Phantom is in enemy roster).

- Rotating floor triggered: "The floor SPINS! Up is down! Left is RIGHT! Hold on!"
- First Pressure Plate activated: "One plate DOWN! Two to go! Can they COORDINATE?!"
- All plates activated (Exit Portal unlocks): "THE PORTAL OPENS! Golden light! The exit is CLEAR! RUN!"
- Repair Drone sabotages pylon: "NO! The drone REVERSES their work! Start AGAIN! Frustration mounts!"
- Round 12 (arena collapses): "The arena DIES! Stone CRUMBLES! Bridges FALL! Escape NOW or be BURIED!"
- Victory: "They CONQUERED the Architect's Test! Mind over stone! Wit over chaos! **Tarsus erupts for the puzzle MASTERS!**"

## GM Tips
- **Pre-Prep Puzzle:** Map out the arena layout with moveable parts (use VTT dynamic walls/doors or physical grid with removable pieces). Test the puzzle solution yourself before session.
- **Visual Aids:** Use distinct colors for pylons (red, blue, green, yellow) and Pressure Plates (circle, square, triangle). Label bridges/walls clearly.
- **Pylon Interaction:** When PC activates pylon, describe mechanical result immediately ("You twist the runes—gears GRIND—North Bridge extends from the wall, locking into place!").
- **Pressure Plate Coordination:** Track which plates are activated; announce "1 of 3... 2 of 3... ALL THREE! Portal unlocking!" to build tension.
- **Repair Drone Sabotage:** If Repair Drones are present, narrate them as "little flying wrenches"—zipping to pylons, reversing gears. Make sabotage visible and interruptible.
- **Sliding Wall Danger:** Warn players before walls slide ("You hear gears grinding—EAST WALL SLIDING!"). Give them a chance to dodge (Dex save) or move away.
- **Rotating Floor Disorientation:** When floor rotates, describe it vividly—"The ground spins beneath you! Your stomach lurches!" Make it cinematic.
- **Collapsing Arena Drama:** When arena begins collapsing, describe cracks spreading, dust falling, distant booms. Make collapse feel inevitable and terrifying.
- **Object Usage:** Encourage creative use of heavy objects (crates, barrels) to hold Pressure Plates. Reward clever solutions with Favor.
- **Architect's Phantom Roleplay:** If present, have Phantom taunt PCs with riddles or criticism ("Too slow! Too stupid! My masterwork is WASTED on you!").

## Aftermath Seeds
- **Patron Interest:** Engineering Guild impressed by spatial reasoning; offers contract to design siege weapons, fortifications, or heist plans.
- **Rumor:** The Architect's ghost was actually a **lich in disguise**—their phylactery hidden somewhere in the arena structure (leads to side quest to retrieve it).
- **Downtime:** PC who activated the most pylons gains **Mechanical Insight** (advantage on Intelligence checks related to traps, mechanisms, or puzzles for 1 week).
- **Injury:** PC crushed by sliding wall develops **Bruised Ribs** (disadvantage on Constitution saves for 1d4 days; removable via *lesser restoration*).
- **Political:** Crowd debates brains vs. brawn again ("They THOUGHT their way out!" vs. "They still had to FIGHT!"). Intellectual patrons impressed; warrior patrons less so.
- **Loot:** Control Pylon fragment (if retrieved) functions as **Architect's Schematic** (grants advantage on Investigation checks to understand building layouts or find secret doors; 250 gp value).
- **Secret:** One of the Pressure Plates contains a **hidden compartment** (Investigation DC 16 to discover; contains blueprint for another arena trap or map of secret passages beneath Tarsus).
