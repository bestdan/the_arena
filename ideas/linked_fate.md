# Linked Fate

- **Hook:** Arcane chains manifest between pairs of gladiators, binding their fates together. When one prospers, both gain strength; when one suffers, both feel the pain. The crowd watches eagerly—will partnership forge legends or collapse in mutual destruction?
- **Party:** 4-6 PCs, paired by arcane binding. Each pair shares health totals and must coordinate actions. Showmanship rewards synchronized strikes.

## Arena Layout
- Circular sand pit (80-foot diameter) with three raised platforms (15-foot diameter each, 5 feet high).
- Glowing arcane circles mark each platform; standing on a circle grants bonuses to paired actions.
- Central obelisk (20 feet high) pulses with binding magic; destroying it ends all chains but triggers consequences.
- Chains appear as visible ethereal tethers (no movement restriction, purely narrative/mechanical link).

## Binding Mechanics (Core Challenge)
**Paired Assignment:**
- GM assigns pairs at session start (or players choose). With odd numbers, one trio shares binding.
- Each pair shares a **combined HP pool** equal to their totals added together.
- Damage to either partner reduces the shared pool.
- Healing affects the shared pool; both partners benefit proportionally.

**Synchronized Actions (Mandatory Cooperation):**
- **Chain Strike:** If both partners attack the same target within the same round, the second attack gains +2d6 damage and +2 to hit.
- **Shield Bond:** Either partner can use their reaction to grant the other resistance to one instance of damage (declare before damage is rolled).
- **Shared Fate:** When one partner gains temp HP, both gain half that amount.
- **Break Point:** If shared HP drops to 25% or below, both partners gain advantage on attacks but disadvantage on saves (desperation mechanic).

**Distance Penalty:**
- If partners are more than 60 feet apart, neither can use synchronized actions until they close distance.
- Beyond 60 feet, shared HP pool begins degrading (1d6 per round to the pool).

## Enemies (coordination hunters)
- 3 Chain Breaker Warriors (use Veterans, CR 3; focus on separating pairs, forced movement attacks).
- 2 Disruption Mages (use Mages, CR 6; *misty step* to reposition, *hold person* to isolate partners, *dispel magic* to temporarily suppress bonds).
- 4 Skirmisher Goblins (CR 1/4; attempt to flank and separate pairs, use Nimble Escape).
- 1 Binding Construct (reskin Shield Guardian, CR 7; absorbs damage for its creator-mage, must be defeated to access mage).
- **Flex:** For 4 PCs (2 pairs), remove 1 Chain Breaker and the Binding Construct. For 6 PCs (3 pairs), add 1 more Disruption Mage and upgrade goblins to Hobgoblins.

## Tactical Notes
- **Chain Breakers:** Use shoves, *thunderwave* effects, grapples to drag partners apart.
- **Disruption Mages:** Target one partner with crowd control while attacking the other; exploit isolation.
- **Skirmishers:** Dart between pairs, create opportunity attacks that force positioning dilemmas.
- **Binding Construct:** Guards a mage; uses *shield* reaction to protect them; partners must coordinate to bypass it.

## Objectives
- **Primary:** Defeat all enemies while maintaining paired bonds.
- **Secondary:** Complete the fight with no pair falling unconscious (shared pool never reaches 0).
- **Bonus:** Execute 3+ Chain Strikes during combat (+2 [[crowds_favor|Favor]] to both partners).

## Crowd Favor Hooks
- Land a Chain Strike that kills an enemy: +2 Favor to both partners.
- Use Shield Bond to save partner from critical damage: +1 Favor to protector, +1 to saved partner.
- Both partners attack from opposite sides of same enemy in one round (flanking coordination): +1 Favor each.
- Rescue isolated partner by crossing 30+ feet to reengage within 60-foot bond range: +2 Favor to rescuer.
- Survive a round with shared HP below 25% and execute successful synchronized action: +3 Favor to both.
- One partner [[last_stand|Last Stands]] while the other fights to stabilize them: +4 Favor split between both.
- Declare [[panache|Panache]] on a Chain Strike and succeed: +3 Favor to both.

## Platform Bonuses
- **North Platform (Aggression):** Chain Strike damage increases to +3d6 while at least one partner stands here.
- **East Platform (Defense):** Shield Bond grants immunity instead of resistance while at least one partner stands here.
- **South Platform (Recovery):** Shared Fate temp HP doubles while at least one partner stands here.
- Moving between platforms costs movement but creates tactical choices for pairs.

## Announcer Beats
- Opening: "Behold! The chains of destiny bind our champions! Will unity forge victory—or will shared suffering drag them to the sands?!"
- First Chain Strike: "SYNCHRONIZED! Two blades, one purpose! The bond STRIKES TRUE!"
- Partner separated beyond 60 feet: "The chain stretches! The bond weakens! Can they reunite before it tears them asunder?!"
- Shield Bond save: "A sacrifice! One takes the blow meant for two! PARTNERSHIP INCARNATE!"
- Shared HP below 25%: "DESPERATION! The bond burns with final fury! Will they rise together or fall as one?!"
- Victory: "United they stood! UNITED THEY CONQUERED! The chains dissolve—but the legend remains!"

## GM Tips
- Clearly mark paired assignments and track shared HP pools separately on index cards or visible tracker.
- Encourage partners to sit together or communicate clearly; this is a "same-room co-op" experience.
- Remind players of 60-foot distance limit every few rounds; use arcane chain visuals to emphasize tension when spread.
- Enemies should actively try to separate pairs—narrate their tactical chatter: "Split them up! Break the bond!"
- If a pair struggles, let crowd throw a rope or chain to help reunite them (bonus action to grab and pull partner 10 feet).
- Let partners strategize between rounds; pause combat briefly for paired tactical discussions.
- Track Chain Strikes publicly on a board; build excitement as pairs execute synchronized attacks.
- Platform bonuses create movement puzzles; pairs must decide who goes where for maximum effect.

## Aftermath Seeds
- **Perfect Partnership:** If no pairs dropped unconscious, military academy offers joint training contract (paired gladiators as officer candidates).
- **Broken Chain:** If any pair's bond caused a defeat, rival gladiators mock them: "Can't even trust your partner's life to you?"
- **Arcane Study:** Wizard patrons approach, fascinated by binding magic; offer lucrative but dangerous experiments involving life-linking rituals.
- **Rumor:** The binding chains were prototype prison magic—designed to ensure co-conspirators can't betray each other. Political implications stir.
- **Injury:** Partners who survived below 25% shared HP develop sympathetic scars: matching marks that tingle when the other is in danger.
- **Downtime:** Paired tactics training available; spend gold to gain +1 to synchronized action bonuses in future sessions.
