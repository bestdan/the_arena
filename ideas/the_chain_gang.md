# The Chain Gang

## Hook
The gladiators are chained together in pairs (or a trio). They must fight as a unit—when one moves, the other is yanked along. Breaking the chains requires solving physical puzzles scattered across the arena, but the chains also grant power when used creatively.

## The Chains
- **15 ft magical chains** connect paired PCs at the waist
- When one PC moves, the other must move with them OR be dragged (DC 12 Strength to resist, takes 5 ft anyway)
- Chains cannot be cut by normal means—only unlocked at **Chain Altars**

### Chain Benefits (Leaning In)
- **Slingshot**: PC A can use action to throw PC B up to 20 ft (PC B can attack at end of movement with advantage)
- **Anchor**: If one PC would fall or be pushed, chained partner can plant feet to prevent (DC 12 Strength)
- **Tandem Attack**: Both PCs attack same target = +2 damage to each hit

### Odd Party Size
- 3 PCs: One chain of 3 (triangle formation, 10 ft chains each)
- 5 PCs: Two pairs + one solo PC who can choose to chain to any pair mid-combat (as action)

## Chain Altars (Puzzle)
3 **Chain Altars** around the arena can unlock chains:
1. **Altar of Sacrifice**: One chained PC must take 10 damage voluntarily
2. **Altar of Trust**: Both PCs must close their eyes (blind) for 1 full round
3. **Altar of Strength**: Combined Athletics check DC 20 (both PCs roll, add together)

Successfully unlocking grants **Chain Blessing**: freed PCs get +1 AC for rest of combat (ghost of chain protects them).

## Arena Layout
- 60 x 60 ft rocky terrain with 3 Chain Altars at corners
- **Central Pit**: 10 ft diameter, 20 ft deep—chains can save a falling partner
- **High Ground**: 10 ft elevated platform in center—good tactical position but hard to reach while chained
- **Weapon Caches**: Two locked caches require simultaneous pressure plates (15 ft apart—perfect for chained pairs)

## Enemies
- **2 Chain Devils** (use Bearded Devil stats, CR 3)—have their OWN chains, try to entangle PCs
- **4 Hobgoblins** (CR 1/2)—fight in disciplined pairs, mock the PCs' clumsy coordination
- Hobgoblins are NOT chained—they're meant to show how "professionals" fight

### Enemy Tactics
- Chain Devils target the chains themselves (chains have AC 15, 20 HP—destroying a chain deals 2d6 force to both PCs)
- Hobgoblins flank around chained pairs, force difficult movement choices

## Crowd's Favor Opportunities
- Execute a perfect Slingshot attack: Panache roll + 2 Favor
- Save chained partner from falling into pit: +2 Favor
- Complete an Altar puzzle dramatically (especially Sacrifice): +2 Favor
- Trip an enemy WITH your chain (improvised attack): Panache roll
- Remain chained by choice after completing altar (for tandem bonuses): +1 Favor (crowd loves commitment)

## Scaling
- **3 PCs**: 1 Chain Devil, 2 Hobgoblins
- **5 PCs**: 2 Chain Devils, 6 Hobgoblins in 3 pairs

## Announcer Beats
- "BOUND together! They must fight as ONE—or fall as TWO!"
- First successful Slingshot: "DID YOU SEE THAT? The chain becomes a WEAPON!"
- PC dragged against will: "OOH, they're not in SYNC! Communication, gladiators!"
- Altar completed: "The chains RELEASE! But was freedom worth the PRICE?"

## GM Tips
- Practice chain movement rules before session—can be confusing
- Draw 15 ft string/stick for visual on tabletop
- Encourage players to strategize together about when to move
- If pair gets stuck, have a hobgoblin mockingly demonstrate good paired movement

## Aftermath Seeds
- Chain Devil chains can be salvaged—magical restraints worth 100 gp to the right buyer
- Gladiators known for chain combat may be hired for "paired exhibition" matches
- Freed chains reform into bracelets—cosmetic souvenirs that hum when wearers are near each other
