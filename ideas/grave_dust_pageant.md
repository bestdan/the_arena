# Grave Dust Pageant

- **Hook:** Necromancers stage a "two-act tragedy"—living challengers first, then the dead rise for an encore.
- **Arena Layout:** Stone tomb markers for partial cover; three bone braziers pulse with necrotic light. Extinguishing a brazier (action) weakens undead (they take +2 damage); leaving them lit empowers necromancer heals. Opening sarcophagi mid-fight may reveal loot or skeletal arms that grapple.

## Encounter (4-6 PCs, mid-tier low level)
- Act I: 2 Gladiators (Thugs) and 1 Bone Naga (focus caster).
- Act II (on Naga 0 HP): 6 Skeletons emerge near PCs and 2 Wights enter from gates.
- **Flex:** For 4 PCs, swap Bone Naga for a Ghast and remove 2 Skeletons. For 6 PCs, add 2 Skeletons and a third Thug.
