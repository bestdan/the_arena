# The Auction Block

- **Hook:** Gladiators become the prize. Wealthy patrons bid on your services, your skills, your very lives—while you fight to impress them. Perform well, earn high bids, and secure powerful sponsors. Fail, and you're sold to the cruelest master in Tarsus.
- **Party:** 4-6 PCs, level 3+. Emphasize showmanship, performance, and strategic pandering to specific patron preferences.

## Arena Layout
- Circular performance pit (80-foot diameter) with **elevated patron boxes** arranged around the perimeter (12 boxes, each holds 1-3 wealthy patrons).
- Center stage contains rotating **Performance Platforms** (3 platforms, 10x10 feet each, rotate to face different patron boxes every 2 rounds).
- Terrain: polished marble floor (no difficult terrain); decorative pillars (full cover, 5 feet wide); hanging silk banners (can be used for acrobatic displays).
- **Auction Gong** (large bronze gong) at arena's edge—rings every 3 rounds to signal bid updates.

## Core Mechanic: Live Bidding
Instead of traditional combat, PCs perform **tasks and challenges** to impress patrons. Patrons bid on PCs in real-time based on performance.

### Patron Profiles
Each patron box houses a specific type of patron with unique preferences:

1. **The War Merchant** (values martial prowess): Bids high for weapon mastery, tactical kills, shield blocks.
2. **The Arcane Collector** (values magic): Bids high for spellcasting displays, magical creativity, counterspells.
3. **The Daredevil Duke** (values risk-taking): Bids high for Panache rolls, dangerous stunts, near-death moments.
4. **The Healer's Consortium** (values support): Bids high for healing allies, protecting others, teamwork.
5. **The Shadow Broker** (values stealth): Bids high for sneaky kills, misdirection, Sleight of Hand tricks.
6. **The Beast Tamer** (values animal handling): Bids high for taming/riding arena beasts, controlling creatures.
7. **The Artisan's Guild** (values craftsmanship): Bids high for tool use, improvisation, creative problem-solving.
8. **The Entertainer** (values showmanship): Bids high for Performance checks, crowd interaction, dramatic flair.
9. **The Executioner** (values efficiency): Bids high for one-shot kills, critical hits, swift victories.
10. **The Scholar** (values knowledge): Bids high for Arcana/History/Religion checks, puzzle-solving, lore displays.
11. **The Noble House** (values honor): Bids high for mercy, sparing foes, chivalric conduct.
12. **The Crime Lord** (values ruthlessness): Bids high for dirty tricks, intimidation, betrayal.

### Bidding Mechanics
- Each patron starts with a **bid pool** based on wealth tier: Noble/Wealthy (400-500 gp), Merchant/Professional (250-350 gp), Minor/Aspiring (100-200 gp).
- After each PC's performance (action, check, or attack), patrons may **increase bids** on that PC if impressed.
- **Bid Increments:** +10 gp (minor success), +25 gp (impressive), +50 gp (extraordinary), +100 gp (legendary).
- At the end of the bout (12 rounds), **highest bidder wins that PC's contract** for the next month (exclusive sponsorship, plot implications).

### Performance Challenges
Instead of fighting to kill, PCs face **staged challenges** designed to showcase skills:

- **Round 1-3:** Weapon demonstrations (strike targets, break objects, duel training dummies).
- **Round 4-6:** Beast handling (tame or ride arena beasts: lions, bears, raptors).
- **Round 7-9:** Obstacle course (acrobatics, athletics, dexterity under pressure).
- **Round 10-12:** Mock combat (PCs vs. NPC gladiators; non-lethal but flashy).

### Influence Tactics
PCs can **directly appeal to patrons** via actions:
- **Call Out:** Shout to a specific patron ("This one's for you, War Merchant!"); if successful, double bid increment.
- **Patron's Request:** Patrons may shout requests mid-bout ("Show me a backflip strike!"); fulfill request = guaranteed +50 gp bid.
- **Rival Bidding:** Two patrons may compete for same PC; PCs can play them against each other (Persuasion DC 15 to escalate bids).

## Objectives
- **Primary:** Earn the **highest total bids** across all PCs (party success = collective sponsor wealth).
- **Secondary:** Each PC secures a **sponsor of their choice** (align with preferred patron to influence bidding).
- **Tertiary:** Avoid **disgrace** (failing spectacularly, killing accidentally, angering patrons = negative bids, sold to Crime Lord or executioner).

## Challenges and Enemies
Instead of traditional combat, PCs face **performance tasks**:

### Weapon Demonstrations (Rounds 1-3)
- **Targets:** Archery bullseyes (AC 15), melee dummies (AC 12), thrown weapon stands.
- **Scoring:** Hit = +10 gp bid; critical hit = +50 gp; miss with natural 1 = -10 gp.
- **War Merchant watches closely**; weapon users gain double bids if impressive.

### Beast Handling (Rounds 4-6)
- Arena releases **3-4 beasts** (lions, bears, or raptors; non-hostile but untamed).
- PCs attempt to **tame** (Animal Handling DC 15), **ride** (Athletics DC 14), or **control** (Performance DC 13).
- **Beast Tamer bids high** for successful handling; **Daredevil Duke bids high** for riding dangerous beasts.
- **Failure:** Beast attacks (non-lethal but damaging); patrons unimpressed.

### Obstacle Course (Rounds 7-9)
- PCs navigate **rotating platforms, swinging ropes, balance beams, climbing walls**.
- **Acrobatics/Athletics checks** (DC 12-16 depending on difficulty).
- **Artisan's Guild, Entertainer, and Daredevil Duke** bid high for stylish completions.
- **Panache-declared stunts** (backflip dismount, rope swing strike) earn bonus bids.

### Mock Combat (Rounds 10-12)
- PCs face **NPC gladiators** (use Guard, Knight, or Veteran; non-lethal combat, first to 0 HP yields).
- **All patrons watch**; performance matters more than victory.
- **War Merchant, Executioner, Daredevil Duke** bid high for impressive strikes.
- **Noble House bids high** if PC shows mercy (spares yielding foe).
- **Crime Lord bids high** if PC uses dirty tricks (cheap shots, intimidation).

## Crowd Favor Hooks
- Impress a patron with exceptional performance: +1 [[crowds_favor|Favor]].
- Fulfill a patron's shouted request perfectly: +2 Favor.
- Use [[panaches|Panache]] successfully during a demonstration: +1 Favor.
- Land a critical hit on bullseye or dummy: +2 Favor.
- Tame a dangerous beast on first attempt: +2 Favor.
- Complete obstacle course without failure: +2 Favor.
- Win mock combat with style (non-lethal finisher, dramatic speech): +2 Favor.
- Convince two patrons to bid against each other: +1 Favor for cleverness.

## Tactical Elements
- **Know Your Audience:** PCs should identify which patrons to impress (based on class/skills). Fighters target War Merchant; Wizards target Arcane Collector, etc.
- **Showmanship Over Efficiency:** Killing efficiently (Executioner) vs. showing mercy (Noble House) = different strategies.
- **Panache Risks:** High-risk Panache rolls impress Daredevil Duke but risk failure (negative bids).
- **Teamwork Displays:** Healing allies, coordinating stunts = impresses Healer's Consortium and Entertainer.
- **Rival Bidding:** If two patrons want same PC, escalate competition (Persuasion to fan flames).

## Hazards and Twists
- **Patron Mood Swings:** If PC fails 3+ times, patrons lose interest (bids stop increasing; may withdraw).
- **Surprise Request:** Mid-bout, a patron demands specific feat ("Do a backflip while hitting the target!"); PC must improvise (skill check at disadvantage unless proficient).
- **Beast Rampage (Round 5):** One beast goes berserk (attacks nearest PC); taming it anyway = huge bids (+100 gp from Beast Tamer).
- **Platform Collapse (Round 8):** One rotating platform breaks; PCs on it make Dex save DC 14 or fall prone (embarrassing; -10 gp bids).
- **Mock Combat Accident (Round 11):** NPC gladiator "accidentally" uses lethal force; PC must choose to match (impress Crime Lord) or show restraint (impress Noble House).

## Announcer Beats
- Opening: "Tonight, they fight not for survival—but for sponsorship! Patrons, open your purses! Gladiators, **show them why you're worth the gold!**"
- First bid: "The War Merchant raises his hand! 50 gold for that strike! **Who will outbid him?!**"
- Patron request: "The Daredevil Duke demands a stunt! **Show him danger, gladiator!**"
- Beast tamed: "Unbelievable! The lion kneels! The Beast Tamer's eyes light with greed!"
- Final bids: "The gong rings for the last time! Final bids, patrons! **Who claims these champions?!**"
- Victory: "Sold! Sold! Sold! New alliances forged in gold and blood! Tarsus applauds wealth and prowess alike!"

## GM Tips
- **Pre-Session Patron Prep:** Print patron profiles; assign each one a personality and bid pool. Track bids on a visible board (shared with players).
- **Encourage Roleplaying:** Let PCs call out to patrons, make pledges, flirt, threaten, or boast. Reward creativity with bonus bids.
- **Non-Lethal Emphasis:** Make it clear this is performance, not death match. PCs can fail without dying (but lose bids/sponsors).
- **Patron Requests:** Every 2-3 rounds, have a patron shout a request ("Show me a shield bash!" "Cast a fireball for me!"). PCs who comply gain instant +50 gp.
- **Bid Tracking:** Use poker chips or tokens to represent bids visually. Let players see which patrons are bidding on whom.
- **Rival Bidding Drama:** If two patrons both want same PC, play it up—verbal sparring, glares, escalating offers. Let PC influence the auction.
- **Failure Consequences:** If PC fails spectacularly (critical miss, botched stunt, killed a beast by accident), patrons may withdraw bids or worse—Crime Lord offers "pity bid" (implies enslavement).

## Aftermath Seeds
- **Patron Contracts:** Each PC is sponsored by highest bidder for next month. This affects:
  - **War Merchant:** Access to rare weapons, military contracts.
  - **Arcane Collector:** Spell scrolls, magical research opportunities.
  - **Daredevil Duke:** High-risk/high-reward missions, celebrity status.
  - **Healer's Consortium:** Medical supplies, access to healers, support network.
  - **Shadow Broker:** Espionage gigs, underworld connections.
  - **Beast Tamer:** Access to exotic mounts, animal companions, hunting contracts.
  - **Artisan's Guild:** Crafting discounts, custom equipment, workshop access.
  - **Entertainer:** Performance venues, fame boost, social connections.
  - **Executioner:** Assassination contracts, lethal equipment, grim reputation.
  - **Scholar:** Library access, research assistance, arcane lore.
  - **Noble House:** Political influence, social standing, courtly protection.
  - **Crime Lord:** Dirty jobs, moral dilemmas, lucrative but dangerous.
- **Rival Sponsors:** If two PCs are sponsored by rival patrons, tensions arise (future plot hook).
- **Disgrace:** PC with lowest bids (or negative bids) is "claimed" by Crime Lord or Executioner against their will (forced into unpleasant contract).
- **Rumor:** One patron is secretly plotting against another; they use sponsored PC as pawn (intrigue subplot).
- **Loot:** Winning bids translate to **signing bonuses** (gold, magic items, services based on patron type).
