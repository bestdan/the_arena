# Last Stand at Broken Tower

- **Hook:** Gladiators defend a crumbling fortress mock-up against waves of "invaders." The crowd roars for every banner held, every wall retaken. Patrons wager on which tower falls first.
- **Party:** 4-6 PCs, level 4+. Emphasize defensive positioning and resource management.

## Arena Layout
- Central keep (20×20 feet, 15-foot-high platform) with two flanking towers (10×10 feet each, 10-foot-high).
- Ramparts connect towers to keep; narrow walkways (5 feet wide) with crenellations for half-cover.
- Three siege ladders positioned around perimeter; enemies climb them to assault the walls.
- Courtyard below scattered with barricades, weapon racks, and burning braziers (can be tipped for 2d6 fire damage, Dex save DC 13).
- Gate at ground level can be barred (action) or smashed open (enemies need 3 successful DC 15 Strength checks).

## Siege Mechanics
- **Waves:** Three waves of attackers, each arriving 3 rounds after the previous wave is reduced to half strength.
- **Objective:** Hold the keep for 10 rounds total. If enemies control the keep platform for 2 consecutive rounds, the defense fails.
- **Ladder Control:** As an action, a PC can shove a ladder away (Athletics DC 12) while no enemy is climbing it, delaying that approach by 1 round.

## Enemies (scaling siege)
**Wave 1 - The Vanguard:**
- 6 Tribal Warriors (scouts and climbers, split across three ladders).
- 1 Berserker (charges the gate, attempting to break it).

**Wave 2 - The Shock Troops:**
- 4 Orcs with javelins (harass from range, then climb).
- 2 Orc Eye of Gruumsh (spellcasters hurling spiritual weapons at defenders).
- 1 Ogre (smashes gate or climbs ladder with advantage due to reach).

**Wave 3 - The Elite:**
- 3 Veterans (coordinated climbers, use pack tactics).
- 1 Wyvern (flies over walls, strafes with poison stinger).
- 2 Goblin Sappers (throw alchemist's fire at defenders, CR 1/4 Goblins with grenades).

**Flex:** For 4 PCs, remove 2 Tribal Warriors from Wave 1 and the Wyvern from Wave 3 (replace with another Veteran). For 6 PCs, add 1 Berserker to Wave 2 and give the Wyvern a rider (Bandit Captain with shortbow).

## Crowd Favor Hooks
- Hold a tower solo for a full round while under attack: +2 Favor.
- Topple a ladder with enemies on it (they fall, take falling damage): +1 Favor.
- Kill an enemy with environmental damage (tipped brazier, thrown from walls): +2 Favor.
- Rally a wounded ally with a [[panache_mechanics|Panache]] declaration: +1 Favor to both.
- Hold the keep for all 10 rounds without it being breached: +3 Favor to all defenders (shared).

## Hazards and Terrain
- **Falling:** Creatures shoved or knocked off walls/towers take 1d6 (10 feet) or 2d6 (15 feet) bludgeoning damage.
- **Crenellations:** Provide half-cover (+2 AC, +2 Dex saves) when fighting from walls.
- **Burning Braziers:** Can be tipped as an action; creates 10-foot square of fire (2d6 damage, ignites flammable objects).
- **Weapon Racks:** Contain improvised heavy weapons (treat as greatclubs or javelins); PCs can grab as bonus action.

## Announcer Beats
- Opening: "Behold the Broken Tower! Will our champions hold the walls—or watch their fortress crumble beneath the tide?"
- Wave 2 arrival: "The siege intensifies! Drums thunder! The Ogre bellows at the gate!"
- Mid-fight: "A ladder falls! Bodies plummet! The crowd is on its feet!"
- Climax: "The Wyvern soars! Poison rains! Will the keep stand?!"
- Victory: "Ten rounds! The banners still fly! The fortress holds! Tarsus salutes its defenders!"

## GM Tips
- Track ladder status on a simple diagram; call out which ladders have climbers.
- Let PCs shout commands to each other; reward tactical positioning (focus fire, covering flanks).
- If a PC falls, have the crowd groan or cheer depending on [[crowds_favor_mechanic|Crowd's Favor]] levels.
- Encourage creative use of environment: dropping rocks, pouring oil, collapsing walkways.
- If pacing drags, have the announcer shout a "rally cry" that grants inspiration to one PC (crowd's whim).

## Aftermath Seeds
- Patron interest: Military commander impressed by defensive tactics; offers sponsorship for "strategic brilliance."
- Rumor: The fortress design was based on a real border keep recently sacked—survivors in the crowd weep or cheer.
- Downtime: Weapons merchant offers discount on siege equipment (portable ram, grappling hooks, alchemist's fire).
- Injury: PC who took most hits from siege weapons gains "Siege Scarred" reputation; crowd recognizes them in future bouts.
