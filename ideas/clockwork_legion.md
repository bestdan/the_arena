# Clockwork Legion

- **Hook:** The Artificer's Guild unveils its masterwork: an army of mechanical soldiers. Patrons wager fortunes on whether flesh can triumph over gears. The crowd chants "BREAK THE MACHINES!" as pistons hiss and gears grind.
- **Party:** 4-6 PCs, level 4+. Emphasize target priority and exploiting construct weaknesses.

## Arena Layout
- Fortified courtyard (80×80 feet) with central Forge Throne (20×20 raised platform, 10 feet high) where the Master Artificer directs the legion.
- Four Assembly Lines (conveyor belts, 5 feet wide, 30 feet long) carry construct reinforcements from corner gates to the center each round.
- Scattered crates and barrels (cover, can be broken open for improvised weapons or oil flasks).
- Arcane Furnaces at two corners (can be sabotaged with DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) or Thieves' Tools; doing so disables one Assembly Line and deals 2d6 fire damage in 15-foot radius).

## Construct Reinforcement Mechanic
- At initiative count 20 (losing ties), one random Assembly Line activates and delivers 1d3 constructs to the battlefield (roll on Construct Spawn Table).
- PCs can sabotage Assembly Lines (action, DC 15 Intelligence check or Thieves' Tools) to shut them down permanently.
- If all four Assembly Lines are active by Round 4, a **Siege Construct** (see below) is assembled and joins the fight.

## Construct Spawn Table (d6)
1-2: 2 Animated Armors (CR 1 each).
3-4: 1 Flying Sword and 1 Rug of Smothering (CR 1/4 and 2).
5: 2 Helmed Horrors (CR 4 each, only on Lines still active after Round 3).
6: 3 Homunculi (CR 0, swarm tactics, poison sting).

## Enemies (clockwork commanders)
- 1 Master Artificer (use Mage; casts *heat metal*, *shatter*, *fabricate*; stays on Forge Throne directing constructs; AC 15 with *mage armor*, 45 HP).
- 1 Clockwork Sentinel (reskin Shield Guardian; follows Artificer's commands; AC 17, 60 HP; can interpose to protect Artificer).
- 2 Gnome Tinkerers (use Scout; bonus action to "repair" a construct within 5 feet for 2d8+2 HP; throw alchemist's fire).
- Starting constructs: 4 Animated Armors, 2 Flying Swords.
- **Flex:** For 4 PCs, remove 1 Gnome Tinkerer and 2 starting Animated Armors. For 6 PCs, start with 6 Animated Armors and add 1 Helmed Horror at Round 2.

## Siege Construct (if all Assembly Lines active by Round 4)
- **Stats:** AC 18, 100 HP, immunity to psychic/poison, resistance to non-magical weapons.
- **Attacks:** Multiattack—two slam attacks (+7, 2d8+4 bludgeoning each).
- **Rampage:** Once per turn, if it reduces a creature to 0 HP, it can move up to half its speed and make one slam attack.
- **Overheat:** If reduced below 50 HP, it vents steam (15-foot cone, 3d6 fire, Dex save DC 14).

## Crowd Favor Hooks
- Sabotage an Assembly Line before it spawns a construct: +1 [[crowds_favor_mechanic|Favor]].
- Destroy 3+ constructs in a single turn (multi-attack, AoE): +2 Favor.
- Land the killing blow on the Master Artificer while standing on the Forge Throne: +3 Favor for dramatic flair.
- Use a construct's ability against other constructs (grapple with Rug, reflect magic with Helmed Horror): +1 Favor.
- Prevent the Siege Construct from ever spawning (shut down all Lines before Round 4): +2 Favor to all (shared).
- Survive a Siege Construct rampage and counter-kill it: +2 Favor.

## Hazards and Tactics
- **Assembly Lines:** Moving hazards; standing on a Line requires DC 12 Dex save or be shoved 10 feet toward center (difficult terrain, potential positioning chaos).
- **Arcane Furnaces:** Sabotaging explodes in 15-foot radius (2d6 fire, Dex save DC 13); also disables one Line permanently.
- **Master Artificer Control:** While alive, all constructs gain +2 to attack rolls. Killing the Artificer removes this bonus and causes constructs to act randomly (50% attack nearest creature, 50% stand idle).
- **Tinkerer Repairs:** Focus fire Tinkerers early; they can negate PC damage output.
- **Construct Immunities:** Poison and psychic damage wasted; remind PCs to adjust tactics.

## Announcer Beats
- Opening: "Behold the Clockwork Legion! Gears mesh! Pistons pound! Can flesh outlast iron?!"
- Assembly Line activates: "The conveyors churn! More steel soldiers march forth! The Guild's genius knows no bounds!"
- Furnace sabotaged: "An explosion! The Line sputters and dies! The crowd roars for sabotage!"
- Siege Construct spawns: "The SIEGE CONSTRUCT RISES! Ten feet of grinding death! Tarsus trembles!"
- Artificer falls: "The Master falls! The machines falter! Chaos in the clockwork ranks!"
- Victory: "Flesh triumphs! The Legion lies in ruin! The Artificers slink away, humiliated!"

## GM Tips
- Track Assembly Lines on a visible diagram; call out which Line activates each round.
- Pre-roll construct spawns to maintain pace; have stat blocks ready.
- Let PCs feel clever for sabotaging Lines—reward strategic thinking with crowd approval.
- If the Siege Construct spawns, make it feel like a boss: narrate its assembly, give it a dramatic entrance.
- Constructs are immune to charm/fear/poison; remind PCs early so they adjust tactics.
- Encourage environmental plays: tip oil barrels onto Assembly Lines, ignite them with spells, etc.

## Aftermath Seeds
- Patron interest: Rival artificer impressed by PCs' tactical dismantling; offers schematics for magical construct companion.
- Rumor: The Master Artificer's notes mention a "Mark II Legion" in development—more deadly, more autonomous.
- Downtime: Scavenged construct parts can be sold for 100 gp per destroyed construct, or traded to a tinkerer for custom magic item modifications.
- Injury: PC hit by Siege Construct's overheat develops temporary "Gearmarked" scar—faint clockwork pattern on skin, fades after 1d4 days.
- Political: Artificer's Guild protests the bout's outcome; future sponsored fights may include sabotage or assassins targeting PCs.
