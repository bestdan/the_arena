# All-Seeing Nightmare

- **Hook:** A beholder crime lord demands "trial by spectacle"—prove the arena worthy of hosting its slaver rings, or watch the city burn from within. The crowd trembles as eye-stalks sweep the stands.
- **Party:** 4-6 PCs, level 10-12. Anti-magic zones, disintegration rays, and tactical positioning dominate.

## Arena Layout
- Cavernous dome (120-foot diameter, 60-foot ceiling) carved from obsidian; beholder floats at center with full aerial mobility.
- Crystalline stalactites dangle at varying heights (15, 30, 45 feet)—can be climbed (Athletics DC 13) or shot down to create falling hazards (3d6 bludgeoning, Dex DC 14 half).
- Three floating platforms (20 feet up, 10-foot squares) orbit slowly around beholder (move 10 feet per round); reaching them requires jump/climb or flight.
- Central anti-magic cone pulses visibly (green glow)—beholder directs it each turn, suppressing magic in 150-foot cone.

## Enemies (beholder mastermind plus minions)
- 1 **Beholder** (CR 13)—uses full eye-ray array and anti-magic cone tactically; stays airborne and mobile.
- 2 **Spectators** (CR 3) as "baby beholders" or lesser kin—guard beholder's flanks, use eye-rays to harass.
- 4 **Cult Fanatics** (CR 2) wielding poison-tipped spears—kneeling cultists chant to "empower the All-Seeing One" (grants beholder +2 AC while all 4 alive).
- **Flex:** For 4 PCs, remove 1 Spectator and 2 Cult Fanatics; beholder uses only 2 eye-rays per turn (instead of 3). For 6 PCs, add 1 **Death Kiss** (beholder-kin, CR 10) or upgrade Spectators to **Gauth** (CR 6 each).

## Beholder Tactical Patterns
- **Round 1-2:** Anti-magic cone sweeps casters, suppressing buffs. Eye-rays target: Charm Ray on tank, Sleep Ray on healer, Telekinetic Ray to hurl PCs off platforms.
- **Round 3-4:** Disintegration Ray on priority target (usually highest-damage dealer). Death Ray on bloodied foes. Spectators focus-fire ranged attackers.
- **Bloodied (90 HP):** Beholder ascends to ceiling, forcing PCs to climb or use ranged. Cult Fanatics form defensive ring below.
- **Critical (45 HP):** Desperation—Disintegration Ray spam and Petrification Ray to create "statues" for post-match display.

## Crowd Favor Hooks
- Dodging Disintegration Ray with visible success (Dex save 16+, taking 0 damage): +3 Favor.
- Silencing all 4 Cult Fanatics within 2 rounds: +2 Favor to party (shared).
- Climbing to a floating platform while under eye-ray fire: +2 Favor.
- Landing melee killing blow on beholder while it's airborne (requires flight or platform jump): +4 Favor ("the impossible strike!").
- Using [[panache_mechanics]] to reflect an eye-ray with a shield or mirror: +3 Favor on success (DM discretion for physics).

## Hazards and Tactics
- Anti-magic cone suppresses *all* magic (spells, magic items, potions)—PCs must position carefully or go mundane.
- Stalactites: Shooting them down onto beholder (ranged attack vs. AC 15, then Dex save DC 14 or 3d6 damage) is viable crowd-pleasing tactic.
- Floating platforms: jumping between requires 10-foot leap (Athletics DC 12) or fall 20 feet (2d6 damage); platforms grant three-quarters cover versus ground-level attackers.
- Cult Fanatics' chant: silencing them (kill, *silence* spell, or intimidation into fleeing) drops beholder AC bonus.

## Announcer Beats
- Opening: "Gaze into the All-Seeing Nightmare—ten eyes of death, one central question: CAN YOU SURVIVE?"
- First Disintegration Ray: "DID YOU SEE THAT?! Dust and ash—one blink and you're GONE!"
- PC climbs to platform: "Look up, Tarsus! Our champions ascend to meet the tyrant EYE TO EYE!"
- Beholder bloodied: "It bleeds! The monster BLEEDS! Finish the abomination!"
- Finale: "The All-Seeing One sees NO MORE!" (victory) or "Bow before your new overlord—those who remain!" (defeat).

## GM Tips
- Anti-magic cone is key: telegraph where it points (describe green beam sweeping). Let casters reposition or rely on cantrips/mundane tactics.
- Eye-rays are random in official rules, but consider letting beholder choose for tactical challenge—keeps fight dynamic.
- Beholder should taunt: "Your magic is NOTHING!" "I see all your futures—DUST!" "Kneel before the All-Seeing!"
- If PCs struggle, have a stalactite "coincidentally" fall near beholder, creating opening (crowd favor spiking).
- Use [[last_stand]] as beholder nears death—one PC might sacrifice to land final blow while Disintegration Ray charges.

## Aftermath Seeds
- Victory: Beholder's central eye (magic item: *Eye of the All-Seer*—allows *detect thoughts* 3/day but cursed with paranoia).
- Defeat: Beholder takes surviving PCs as "trophies" for slaver ring; rescue mission or rival gladiators free them later.
- Cult remnants: Fanatics scatter; one approaches PCs later with info on beholder's crime network (if beholder dead) or revenge plot (if alive).
- Patron interest: Aboleth or mind flayer observes from crowd—impressed by mental fortitude against beholder's rays; makes cryptic offer.
- City impact: If beholder dies, its slaver rings collapse; if it lives, Tarsus nobility nervously kowtow to new power.
