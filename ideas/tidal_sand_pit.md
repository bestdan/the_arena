# Tidal Sand Pit

- **Hook:** "Will they drown in dust?" Arena master floods sand with underground sluices, turning the floor into sucking mud.
- **Arena Layout:** Four stone platforms rise from semi-liquid sand. Wooden planks can bridge gaps but collapse after one crossing. Perimeter ballistae are chained to winches; bolts can be retrieved and re-aimed with a full action.

## Encounter (4-6 PCs, mid-tier low level)
- 1 Bulette pup leaping between platforms (use Young Bulette or reskinned Ankheg).
- 4 Hobgoblins with pike-and-hook poles to drag PCs into the mire.
- 1 Hobgoblin Devastator commanding from a platform.
- **Flex:** For 4 PCs, drop the Devastator and replace with a regular Hobgoblin. For 6 PCs, add 2 Guards acting as arena attendants who cut planks mid-fight.
