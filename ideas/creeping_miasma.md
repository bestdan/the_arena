# Creeping Miasma

- **Hook:** "Breathe deep and die!" Poisonous gas vents seep from the arena floor, releasing choking clouds that expand and merge. Gladiators must constantly move to fresh air while fighting gas-immune enemies. Stay in the miasma too long, and suffocation claims you before the monsters do.
- **Party:** 4-6 PCs, level 6+. Tests mobility under pressure, resource management, and tactics against poison-immune foes.

## Arena Layout
- Circular arena (140-foot diameter) with stone floor marked by 12 gas vent grates (evenly spaced).
- **Gas Vents:** Ornate bronze grates (5-foot diameter) release poison gas clouds.
- **Safe Zones:** Areas without gas; constantly shifting as clouds expand and dissipate.
- **Raised Ledges:** 4 stone ledges (10 feet wide, 5 feet high) around arena perimeter—above gas cloud height, limited space.
- **Air Circulation:** Strong winds occasionally disperse clouds (random chance each round).

## Poison Gas Mechanic
- **Initiative Count 20:** 1d4 vents activate (or all on specific rounds for escalation).
- **Gas Cloud:** 20-foot radius sphere of poisonous fog (heavily obscured, lasts 3 rounds unless dispersed).
- **Cloud Expansion:** Each round, active clouds expand 5 feet outward (max 30-foot radius before dissipating).
- **Poison Damage:** Creatures starting turn in gas must make Constitution save DC 15.
  - Fail: Take 3d6 poison damage and poisoned condition until end of next turn.
  - Fail by 5+: Also stunned until end of turn (choking, gasping).
- **Holding Breath:** Creatures can hold breath to avoid initial exposure (1 + Con modifier rounds), but still obscured vision.
- **Cumulative Exposure:** After 5 rounds in gas (cumulative, not consecutive), Constitution save DC 16 or gain 1 level exhaustion.

## Gas Cloud Dynamics
- **Merging Clouds:** When two clouds overlap, they combine into larger heavily obscured area.
- **Wind Dispersal:** At initiative count 10, roll d20—on 15+, strong wind disperses all gas for 1 round (everyone can breathe, sight restored).
- **Height Advantage:** Creatures on raised ledges (5+ feet above floor) are above gas layer (can breathe, can see down into clouds).
- **Fire Interaction:** Fire spells/effects entering gas cause flash combustion (all creatures in 20-foot radius take 2d6 fire damage, gas burns away).

## Enemies (poison-immune aberrations and undead)
- 3 Cloakers (CR 8 each; reduced HP to ~50 each for balance; fly above gas, phantasms create fear, moan causes confusion).
- 2 Carrion Crawlers (CR 2 each; immune to poison, paralytic tentacles, burrow to emerge from vents).
- 1 Mummy Lord Remnant (reskin Mummy Lord to CR 10 with reduced HP ~100; immune to poison, rotting fist causes mummy rot, legendary actions).
- 4 Gas Spores (CR 1/2 each; float through gas clouds, death burst releases more spores/gas).
- **Flex:** For 4 PCs, reduce to 2 Cloakers and remove Mummy Lord. For 6 PCs, add 1 more Cloaker and restore Mummy Lord to full stats.

## Enemy Tactics
- **Cloakers:** Fly above gas clouds, use moan to force PCs deeper into gas; phantasms create fear (frightened PCs flee into more gas).
- **Carrion Crawlers:** Burrow beneath vents, emerge to paralyze PCs in gas (paralyzed = auto-fail Con saves, death spiral).
- **Mummy Lord Remnant:** Stands in densest gas concentration, immune to poison; rotting fist + gas damage overwhelms PCs.
- **Gas Spores:** Float aimlessly through clouds; when killed, death burst releases spore infestation (Constitution save DC 13 or diseased).

## Crowd Favor Hooks
- Survive 5 rounds in poison gas without taking damage (Constitution saves or immunity): +2 [[crowds_favor|Favor]] for endurance.
- Use fire spell to burn away gas cloud dramatically: +2 Favor for environmental mastery.
- Defeat an enemy while both in heavily obscured gas (blind fighting): +2 Favor for skill.
- Climb to raised ledge and make ranged attacks from safety: +1 Favor for tactical positioning.
- Rescue ally from gas by pulling them to fresh air: +1 Favor for teamwork.
- Kill the Mummy Lord while standing in gas cloud: +3 Favor for facing death head-on.
- Never enter a gas cloud throughout entire fight: +3 Favor for perfect avoidance.

## Hazards and Environment
- **Poison Gas:** Constant threat requiring movement and saves; cumulative exposure causes exhaustion.
- **Heavily Obscured:** Fighting blind (disadvantage on attacks, enemies have advantage) in gas clouds.
- **Choking/Stunned:** Failed saves can stun, leaving PCs helpless in gas for multiple rounds.
- **Paralyzing Tentacles:** Carrion Crawler paralysis + gas damage = lethal combo.
- **Mummy Rot:** Disease from Mummy Lord prevents healing, compounds gas damage problem.
- **Gas Spore Infestation:** Disease prevents regaining HP (even outside gas) until cured.

## Announcer Beats
- Opening: "THE MIASMA RISES! Poison chokes the air! Will they find breath—or SUFFOCATE?!"
- First gas release: "VENTS OPEN! Green fog billows! They scatter—RUN FROM THE POISON!"
- PC in gas: "He stumbles into the cloud! Coughing! Choking! Can he escape?!"
- Fire spell combustion: "FIREBALL INTO THE GAS! BOOM! The cloud IGNITES! Brilliant and deadly!"
- Wind dispersal: "A GUST! The winds clear the air—for now! Breathe while you can!"
- Paralyzing tentacle: "TENTACLES! She's paralyzed! Trapped in the poison! Will allies save her?!"
- Victory: "They stand in clean air! Lungs burning but victorious! The miasma recedes!"

## GM Tips
- Use colored tokens or templates to show gas cloud positions and sizes clearly.
- Track cumulative gas exposure per PC (easy to forget, but creates dramatic exhaustion moments).
- Remind PCs about holding breath option (but note they're still blind in clouds).
- Enemies should herd PCs into gas—Cloakers use fear, Carrion Crawlers block exits.
- Narrate poison viscerally: "Your lungs burn," "You taste copper," "Vision swims."
- Let creative solutions shine: *gust of wind* to disperse gas, *protection from poison*, fire spells to burn it.
- If PC is paralyzed in gas, describe their helplessness: "You can't move! The poison fills your lungs!"
- Wind dispersal should feel like a gift from the gods (moment of relief in desperate fight).

## Aftermath Seeds
- Patron interest: Alchemist guild impressed by "poison resistance"; offers contract testing antidotes (risky, pays extremely well).
- Rumor: The gas vents connect to underground poison springs—cultists worship toxic entity below arena.
- Downtime: Carrion Crawler mucus can be harvested (crafted into paralytic poison for weapons, alchemist required, 100 gp value).
- Injury: PC with severe cumulative gas exposure develops "Scarred Lungs"—permanent Constitution -1, disadvantage on saves vs. poison.
- Political: Arena questioned about safety regulations—patron deaths from gas leakage into stands prompt investigation.
- Reward: Mummy Lord's burial mask (can be sold for 300 gp or worn for immunity to disease, cursed with nightmares of entombment).
