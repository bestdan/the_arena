# Beast and Masters

- **Party:** 5 Level 2 PCs; includes optional NPC aid.
- **Theme:** Target priority and environmental awareness while a trained beast follows handler commands.

## Setup
Arena scattered with pillars, weapon racks, and partial walls. A trained Owlbear is released alongside its handler-trainers.

## Enemies
- 1 Owlbear (CR 3) as main threat.
- 3 Beast Handlers (use Scout, CR 1/2) who net/bola and command the beast.

## NPC Support
- Option A: Merryn joins as archer support.
- Option B: Rohm plus one steppes youth (e.g., Tovo); Rohm protects the youth at all costs.

## Tactical Elements
- Handlers spend actions to direct Owlbear attacks or multiattack.
- If all handlers die, Owlbear goes berserk and attacks nearest creature.
- Pillars grant cover; can be knocked over (Athletics) to make difficult terrain.

## Crowd Mechanics
- Dramatic Panache kill on a handler: +1 Favor.
- Survive an Owlbear hit and stay standing: +1 Favor.
- Turn the Owlbear against handlers: +2 Favor to the orchestrator.

## Drama Hooks
- NPC ally gets grabbed by Owlbear—save them or let them die.
- Handlers offer a yield: call off beast if PCs surrender (lose all Favor but live).
- Crowd favorite can spend 3 Favor to have a chain thrown to restrain the Owlbear (contested Strength).
