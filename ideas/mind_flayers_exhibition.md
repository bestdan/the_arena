# Mind Flayer's Exhibition

- **Hook:** An illithid elder-brain spawn demands "demonstration of will"—psychic supremacy versus mortal determination. The crowd's thoughts echo in the arena. Resist the mind-shatter... or become thralls.
- **Party:** 4-6 PCs, level 7-9. Psychic damage, mental saves, and thrall mechanics test Intelligence/Wisdom builds.

## Arena Layout
- Spherical psychic chamber (80-foot diameter)—gravity shifts based on mind flayer's will (initiative 20: rotate gravity 90 degrees, all creatures make DC 14 Dex save or fall 20 feet in new "down").
- Four psionic amplifiers (crystalline pillars, 10 feet tall)—mind flayer uses them to boost psychic blasts. Destroying amplifier (AC 13, 25 HP, vulnerable to thunder) reduces blast range by 20 feet.
- Thought-pool at center (15-foot diameter)—liquid psychic energy; entering requires DC 15 Int save or stunned for 1 round. Mind flayer can telepathically "see" any creature that touched pool.
- Silence zones (3 randomly placed 20-foot spheres)—psionic dead zones where telepathy fails and mind flayer's abilities have disadvantage.

## Enemies (illithid mastermind plus dominated servants)
- 1 **Mind Flayer** (CR 7)—uses Mind Blast, Extract Brain, and Plane Shift (escape option). Stays near amplifiers.
- 4 **Intellect Devourers** (CR 2)—burrow from walls, attempt Body Thief on low-Int PCs.
- 2 **Dominated Warriors** (reskin Gladiators)—former arena champions, now thralls with vacant eyes. Attack nearest non-thrall.
- **Flex:** For 4 PCs, remove 2 Intellect Devourers and 1 Dominated Warrior; mind flayer has disadvantage on Mind Blast recharge. For 6 PCs, add 1 **Grell** (CR 3) as illithid's pet and 2 more Intellect Devourers.

## Mind Flayer Tactics
- **Opening:** Mind Blast (60-foot cone, Int save DC 15 or stunned 1 minute); Intellect Devourers swarm stunned targets.
- **Mid-Fight:** Extract Brain attempts on isolated PCs; Dominated Warriors body-block rescuers.
- **Bloodied (half HP):** Rotates gravity to scatter party; teleports to opposite amplifier.
- **Critical (20 HP):** Desperation—mass domination attempt (all PCs within 30 feet, contested Int check) or Plane Shift escape (leaves Intellect Devourers to finish).

## Crowd Favor Hooks
- Resisting Mind Blast while adjacent to mind flayer (save DC 15+ while within 5 feet): +3 Favor.
- Destroying psionic amplifier while stunned ally recovers: +2 Favor.
- Saving dominated ally from Extract Brain (killing Intellect Devourer in PC's skull): +3 Favor ("miracle rescue!").
- Using [[panache_mechanics]] to "psychic duel" mind flayer (Intelligence contest instead of attack): +3 Favor on success.
- Forcing mind flayer into silence zone: +2 Favor.

## Hazards and Psychic Defenses
- **Gravity shifts:** falling damage applies, but can reposition party creatively (fall "sideways" to flank).
- **Thought-pool:** PCs who enter voluntarily can attempt to "poison" it (Arcana DC 16)—gives mind flayer disadvantage on next psychic ability.
- **Psionic amplifiers:** destroying all four makes mind flayer vulnerable to psychic damage (normally immune).
- **Silence zones:** party casters can use *silence* spell to create more; mind flayer panics when surrounded.

## Announcer Beats
- Opening: "THE MIND FLAYER! Its thoughts SCREAM across the arena—will our gladiators' minds HOLD?"
- Mind Blast hits: "STUNNED! The psychic wave crashes—WHO CAN RESIST?"
- Dominated ally turns: "HORROR! Comrade against comrade—the mind flayer's puppet ATTACKS!"
- Amplifier destroyed: "The crystal SHATTERS! The illithid's power WANES!"
- Finale: "MIND OVER MATTER! The aberration FALLS!" (victory) or "Thoughts... fading... obey... the... Elder..." (defeat, crowd starts to blank out).

## GM Tips
- Mind Blast is devastating—telegraph with illithid's tentacles writhing, psionic hum building.
- Dominated Warriors should be recognizable—use NPC names from previous sessions ("That's... that's KAEL! What has it DONE to him?").
- Intellect Devourers inside PCs create moral dilemma—killing the body kills the PC's brain; need *dispel evil*, *protection from evil*, or creative solutions.
- Let low-Int PCs shine with physical prowess; high-Int PCs can counter-psychic or identify weaknesses.
- Use [[last_stand]] when PC resists domination at cost—burns out brain to save party from thralldom.

## Aftermath Seeds
- Victory: Mind flayer's elder-brain fragment (magic item: *Illithid Brain Jar*—grants telepathy 60 feet but cursed with hunger for knowledge).
- Defeat: PCs become thralls; elder-brain uses them for infiltration (rescue/deprogramming quest).
- Dominated Warriors: If saved, they remember nothing but owe life-debt to PCs (future allies).
- Intellect Devourer escape: Some survive, burrow into Tarsus sewers (infestation side quest).
- Psychic scars: PCs gain minor telepathy (30 feet, can communicate silently) but suffer nightmares (exhaustion risk).
- Elder-brain response: If mind flayer killed, elder-brain sends stronger illithid for revenge (future BBEG escalation).
