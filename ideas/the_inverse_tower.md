# The Inverse Tower

## Hook
A wizard patron has enchanted the arena: gravity reverses every 3 rounds. The "floor" becomes the "ceiling" and everyone falls UP. The party must fight flying creatures who don't care about gravity while managing the chaos of suddenly plummeting toward the sky.

## Mechanics

### Gravity Shifts
- **Rounds 1-3**: Normal gravity (floor is down)
- **Rounds 4-6**: Inverted gravity (ceiling is down—everyone falls 30 ft UP)
- **Rounds 7-9**: Normal again
- Pattern continues until combat ends

### Falling Damage
- First inversion: 3d6 falling damage (30 ft fall to ceiling), DC 13 Dex save for half
- Subsequent inversions: creatures learn to brace—DC reduces by 2 each time (minimum DC 9)
- Creatures can grab anchor points (chains, pillars) as reaction to avoid falling

### Anchor Points
- 6 iron chains hang from ceiling/floor—can be grabbed (DC 10 Athletics)
- Holding a chain = no falling damage, but restrained until you let go
- Chains can hold 2 Medium creatures each

## Arena Layout (Vertical)
- 40 ft between floor and ceiling
- **Floor Level**: Starting positions, weapon racks, one healing potion (hidden under debris)
- **Ceiling Level**: Mirror image—weapon racks attached "upside down," one enemy nest
- **Mid-Air**: 6 hanging chains, 2 floating platforms (10 ft diameter, hover via magic)
- **Floating Platforms**: Don't obey gravity inversions—always stay in middle

## Enemies
- **3 Stirges** (CR 1/8)—fly, unaffected by gravity, attach and drain
- **1 Peryton** (CR 2)—main threat, uses dive attacks during inversions
- **1 Gravity-Bound Gladiator** (Thug stats, CR 1/2)—also suffers gravity shifts, forced ally of convenience?

### The Gravity-Bound Gladiator
- Another prisoner, also trapped in this madness
- Will propose temporary alliance: "Help me kill the bird, then we fight fair"
- If party agrees, fights alongside them until Peryton dies, then challenges strongest PC to honorable duel
- If party refuses, he attacks weakest PC during next inversion

## Environmental Hazards
- **Loose Debris**: Weapons, shields, rocks—fall during each inversion (1d6 bludgeoning to random creature in path)
- **Spike Ceiling**: One 15 ft section of ceiling has iron spikes—falling onto it = 2d6 piercing extra
- **Broken Platform**: One floating platform is cracked—more than 300 lbs causes it to tilt (DC 12 Dex or fall)

## Crowd's Favor Opportunities
- Kill an enemy mid-fall during inversion: Panache roll + 2 Favor
- Save an ally from falling onto spikes: +2 Favor
- Fight the Gravity-Bound Gladiator honorably after alliance: +2 Favor (crowd loves honor)
- Betray the Gladiator mid-handshake: -1 Favor but tactical advantage (crowd boos but remembers ruthlessness)
- Grab a chain one-handed while fighting: Panache roll

## Scaling
- **3 PCs**: 2 Stirges, no Peryton (use Giant Vulture instead)
- **5 PCs**: 4 Stirges, Peryton has max HP

## Announcer Beats
- "Gravity is a SUGGESTION in the Inverse Tower! Hold onto your STOMACHS!"
- First inversion: "UP THEY GO! The world flips! Who will land on their FEET?"
- Peryton dive-attacks: "The beast STRIKES from above—or is it below? WHO CAN TELL?"
- Alliance with enemy gladiator: "An ALLIANCE? In the arena? The crowd watches this fragile TRUCE..."

## Wizard Patron (Voice Only)
- Appears as floating arcane eye
- Amused by chaos, occasionally casts minor illusions for dramatic effect
- If party impresses: offers future patronage (access to gravity-related magic items)
- If party bores: threatens to add a THIRD gravity direction (sideways) in future matches

## Aftermath Seeds
- Peryton heart is valuable to alchemists (75 gp)
- Gravity-Bound Gladiator, if spared, becomes camp rival or reluctant ally
- Wizard patron Zephyrus the Inverted becomes recurring figure—loves "interesting" contestants
