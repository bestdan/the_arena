# Blazing Shadows

- **Hook:** "Will they dance with the sun?" A brutal artificial sun blazes overhead, scorching the arena floor. Only by staying within the moving shadows cast by enormous floating moon-stones can gladiators avoid searing damage. The crowd watches as combatants scramble between shadows while fighting for their lives.
- **Party:** 4-6 PCs, level 5+. Emphasize mobility, positioning, and resource management under constant environmental pressure.

## Arena Layout
- Circular arena (120-foot diameter) with packed dirt floor.
- **The Scorching Sun:** Magical orb suspended 80 feet overhead radiates intense heat and light.
- **Moon-Stones:** 4 massive floating spheres (20 feet diameter each) orbit slowly around the arena at 40-foot height, casting 30-foot diameter shadows on the ground.
- **Shadow Movement:** At initiative count 20 (losing ties), all moon-stones rotate 30 feet clockwise around the arena center. Shadows move with them.
- **Shadow Coverage:** Shadows overlap occasionally but never cover the entire floor. Roughly 40-50% of arena is shadowed at any time.

## Burning Sun Mechanic
- **Sunlight Damage:** Any creature starting its turn in direct sunlight takes 2d6 fire damage (no save).
- **Shadow Safety:** Creatures fully within shadow are immune to sunlight damage.
- **Partial Coverage:** Creature partially in shadow takes half damage (1d6 fire).
- **Heat Exhaustion:** After 5 rounds in direct sunlight (cumulative, not consecutive), creature gains 1 level of exhaustion (max 2 from this effect).

## Shadow Tracking
- GM marks shadow positions at start of each round (or uses tokens/templates on battle map).
- PCs can predict shadow movement with Intelligence (Arcana) check DC 12 to know where shadows will be next round.
- **Alternative: Shadow Riddles** (see below for dramatic prediction mechanic).
- Movement between shadows requires careful planning—too slow and you burn.

## Shadow Riddles (Optional Mechanic)
Instead of (or in addition to) the Arcana check, the arena's announcer or mystical voice can pose riddles to the combatants. Solving a riddle correctly grants perfect knowledge of where ONE specific moon-stone's shadow will move on the next round. This adds theatrical flair and rewards clever thinking.

**Riddle Mechanic:**
- At initiative count 20 (when shadows move), any PC can attempt to solve a riddle as a bonus action.
- GM poses one riddle from the list below (or creates a new one).
- Correct answer reveals exactly where one moon-stone's shadow will be next round.
- Each riddle can only be used once per encounter.
- Wrong answers grant no information but don't waste the attempt.

**Sample Riddles:**
1. **"I follow behind you by day, but vanish when clouds come to play. What am I?"**
   - *Answer:* A shadow (or your shadow)
   - *Reveals:* The moon-stone directly behind the party's current position will cast its shadow 30 feet clockwise.

2. **"Four sisters dance in circles round, their dark daughters touch the ground. The eldest leads, the youngest trails. Which daughter will save you when the sun assails?"**
   - *Answer:* The first/eldest (or the leading moon-stone's shadow)
   - *Reveals:* The frontmost moon-stone in the rotation will cast its shadow in the direction of movement.

3. **"Light and dark are partners bound, one flees while one pursues around. If darkness moves where light has been, where will safety next be seen?"**
   - *Answer:* Where the light currently is (or following the current sunlight/clockwise)
   - *Reveals:* Shadows move into areas currently in sunlight, rotating clockwise.

4. **"The sphere that rides highest catches first the flame, its child below seeks refuge just the same. Name the direction, win the game."**
   - *Answer:* Clockwise/sunwise/right (depending on orientation)
   - *Reveals:* All shadows move 30 feet clockwise from current positions.

5. **"Four dancers spin, their partners meet. When two dark daughters share the street, where will their embrace be sweet?"**
   - *Answer:* Where shadows overlap/where two shadows meet
   - *Reveals:* Shows where two shadows will overlap next round, creating a larger safe zone.

6. **"When fire above and dancers high complete their turn beneath the sky, the shadow you seek won't stay or flee—it moves the distance of how many of thee?"**
   - *Answer:* One (30 feet, roughly one creature's dash distance)
   - *Reveals:* Exact distance shadows move (30 feet) and confirms clockwise direction.

7. **"The sun's eye never blinks or turns, yet what it sees still shifts and burns. To know your haven one step hence, look where darkness is most dense."**
   - *Answer:* Where shadows overlap/the darkest spot
   - *Reveals:* Shows the position where shadows will overlap next round.

**GM Tips for Riddles:**
- Present riddles in dramatic announcer voice or as mystical whispers from the moon-stones.
- Accept creative answers that demonstrate understanding of the shadow mechanic.
- For groups struggling, offer hints after one round: "The answer lies in what you've already seen!"
- Reward especially clever or dramatic answers with +1 [[crowds_favor|Favor]].
- Mix riddles with standard Arcana checks so players have multiple paths to prediction.
- If players solve riddles too easily, the announcer can mock enemies: "Even the condemned know the dance better than you, Efreeti!"

## Enemies (heat-adapted hunters)
- 3 Fire Elementals (CR 5 each; immune to fire, thrive in sunlight, actively push PCs into sun).
- 2 Salamanders (CR 5 each; heat metal weapons, constriction, prefer lurking in shadows to ambush).
- 1 Efreeti Enforcer (CR 11; reduced HP to ~150 for balance; flame-based attacks, gaseous form to reposition, commands the elementals).
- 4 Magma Mephits (CR 1/4 each; swarm tactics, death burst when killed creates brief fire hazards).
- **Flex:** For 4 PCs, remove 1 Fire Elemental and reduce Efreeti HP to 120. For 6 PCs, add 2 more Salamanders and increase Efreeti to full stats.

## Enemy Tactics
- **Fire Elementals:** Grapple PCs and drag them into sunlight; position to block shadow access.
- **Salamanders:** Use *heat metal* on armored PCs to force them to choose between armor and shadow safety.
- **Efreeti:** Stays airborne, uses *wall of fire* to cut off shadow paths; commands elementals to herd PCs.
- **Magma Mephits:** Suicide rush into PC groups in shadows; death burst forces repositioning.

## Crowd Favor Hooks
- Predict shadow movement and position perfectly for next round: +1 [[crowds_favor|Favor]].
- Defeat an enemy while both of you are in direct sunlight (taking damage): +2 Favor for defying the sun.
- Use *heat metal* or fire damage against fire-immune enemies creatively (environmental kills): +2 Favor.
- Survive 3 consecutive rounds in direct sunlight without dropping: +2 Favor for endurance.
- Shove an enemy from shadow into sunlight dramatically: +1 Favor.
- Kill the Efreeti with a cold-based attack: +3 Favor for ironic justice.

## Hazards and Environment
- **Sunlight Damage:** Constant threat; positioning is survival.
- **Shadow Overlap:** Occasionally two shadows merge, creating larger safe zones (rare, tactical opportunity).
- **Heat Metal:** Salamanders force PCs to drop weapons/armor or suffer ongoing damage in addition to sunlight.
- **Wall of Fire:** Efreeti blocks escape routes; Dex save DC 16 or take 5d8 fire damage crossing.
- **Exhaustion:** Prolonged sun exposure weakens PCs (disadvantage on checks, reduced speed).

## Announcer Beats
- Opening: "The sun rises over Tarsus! But this is no gentle dawn—this is the BLAZING JUDGMENT! Dance with the shadows or BURN!"
- First sunlight damage: "Flesh sizzles! Smoke rises! The gladiator stumbles into the light—WILL THEY RETREAT?!"
- Shadow chase: "The moons turn! The shadows shift! Run! RUN! The sun shows no mercy!"
- Enemy dragged into sunlight: "The Salamander screams! Its own element betrays—NO! It thrives! But the human BURNS!"
- Creative kill: "FROZEN BLADE THROUGH FLAME! The Efreeti's eyes widen—impossible! The crowd ROARS!"
- Victory: "They stand in shadow, triumphant! The sun sets on their enemies! Tarsus has witnessed the dance of survival!"

## GM Tips
- Use physical templates or tokens to show shadow positions clearly; movement is critical.
- Give PCs one free "shadow position prediction" at start of combat to help them understand the mechanic.
- Narrate heat viscerally: "Your skin blisters," "The air shimmers with killing heat," "Your hair singes."
- Let PCs experiment: "Can I use *control water* to create steam/cover?" (Creative solutions earn Favor).
- Track exhaustion publicly; let players weigh risk vs. reward of staying in sun.
- If a PC drops from heat exhaustion, describe the crowd's reaction—some jeer, some show pity.
- Enemies should actively use the environment; Fire Elementals are intelligent hunters.

## Aftermath Seeds
- Patron interest: Fire cult leader impressed by "sun survival"; offers initiation into flame mysteries (risky power, potential corruption).
- Rumor: The artificial sun is a captured djinn's heart—activist groups plot to free it, arena collapse possible.
- Downtime: Salamander scales can be harvested (resistance to fire damage for 1 hour if crafted into salve, alchemist required, 75 gp cost).
- Injury: PC with severe sunburns develops "Sun-Scarred" trait—disadvantage on Charisma checks due to disfigurement, but advantage on Intimidation vs. fire creatures.
- Political: Rival gladiators accuse PCs of receiving "shadow tips" from arena staff—investigation into cheating allegations.
- Reward: Efreeti's brass chains (can be sold for 200 gp or crafted into *bracers of defense* by skilled smith).
