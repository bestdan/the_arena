# Blazing Shadows

- **Hook:** "Will they dance with the sun?" A brutal artificial sun blazes overhead, scorching the arena floor. Only by staying within the moving shadows cast by enormous floating moon-stones can gladiators avoid searing damage. The crowd watches as combatants scramble between shadows while fighting for their lives.
- **Party:** 4-6 PCs, level 5+. Emphasize mobility, positioning, and resource management under constant environmental pressure.

## Arena Layout
- Circular arena (120-foot diameter) with packed dirt floor.
- **The Scorching Sun:** Magical orb suspended 80 feet overhead radiates intense heat and light.
- **Moon-Stones:** 4 floating spheres of varying sizes orbit slowly around the arena at 40-foot height:
  - **Father (Huge):** 30-foot diameter sphere, casts 40-foot diameter shadow, starts at North position
  - **Mother (Large):** 20-foot diameter sphere, casts 30-foot diameter shadow, starts at East position
  - **Brother (Small):** 15-foot diameter sphere, casts 20-foot diameter shadow, starts at South position
  - **Sister (Small):** 15-foot diameter sphere, casts 20-foot diameter shadow, starts at West position
- **Shadow Movement:** At initiative count 20 (losing ties), all moon-stones rotate 30 feet clockwise around the arena center. Shadows move with them. Use compass directions to track positions (North, East, South, West, and intermediary positions).
- **Shadow Coverage:** Shadows overlap occasionally. Every 4 rounds, all four shadows converge at the arena center focal point, creating a 50-foot diameter zone of complete shadow safety.

## Burning Sun Mechanic
- **Sunlight Damage:** Any creature starting its turn in direct sunlight takes 2d6 fire damage (no save).
- **Shadow Safety:** Creatures fully within shadow are immune to sunlight damage.
- **Partial Coverage:** Creature partially in shadow takes half damage (1d6 fire).
- **Heat Exhaustion:** After 5 rounds in direct sunlight (cumulative, not consecutive), creature gains 1 level of exhaustion (max 2 from this effect).

## Shadow Tracking
- GM marks shadow positions at start of each round using compass directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW).
- Use distinct tokens for Father (largest), Mother (medium), Brother & Sister (smallest) to track positions.
- PCs can predict shadow movement with Intelligence (Arcana) check DC 12 to know where one specific shadow will be next round.
- **Alternative: Shadow Riddles** (see below for dramatic prediction mechanic).
- Movement between shadows requires careful planning—too slow and you burn.
- **Focal Point Convergence:** Every 4 rounds, all shadows meet at the arena center. Track this cycle clearly.

## Shadow Riddles (Optional Mechanic)
Instead of (or in addition to) the Arcana check, the arena's announcer or mystical voice can pose riddles to the combatants. Solving a riddle correctly grants perfect knowledge of where ONE specific moon-stone's shadow will move on the next round. This adds theatrical flair and rewards clever thinking.

**Riddle Mechanic:**
- At initiative count 20 (when shadows move), any PC can attempt to solve a riddle as a bonus action.
- GM poses one riddle from the list below (or creates a new one).
- **Silent Riddles:** Answer reveals information directly to the solver.
- **Shouted Riddles:** Must use an **Amplifying Stone** (bonus action) to yell the answer, making the information available to all combatants (including enemies). Amplifying Stones are scattered around the arena (DC 12 Perception to locate, 3 available).
- Each riddle can only be used once per encounter.
- Wrong answers grant no information but don't waste the attempt.

**Sample Riddles:**

**Silent Riddles (solve and learn quietly):**

1. **"I follow behind you by day, but vanish when clouds come to play. What am I?"**
   - *Answer:* A shadow (or your shadow)
   - *Reveals:* Father's shadow will move from North toward East (clockwise 30 feet).

2. **"The family gathers in shadow's embrace. Four become one in a darkened space. When next will this reunion take place?"**
   - *Answer:* A number (e.g., "3" or "1" or "Now")
   - *Reveals:* Exactly when all four shadows will converge at the focal point (every 4 rounds).

3. **"Two small, one medium, one grand. Which casts the widest net on the sand?"**
   - *Answer:* Father (or the largest/Huge)
   - *Reveals:* Father's shadow (40-foot diameter) current and next position.

4. **"Light and dark are partners bound, one flees while one pursues around. If Mother's darkness moves where light has been, where will her safety next be seen?"**
   - *Answer:* East (or the next compass position clockwise from her current position)
   - *Reveals:* Mother's shadow moves 30 feet clockwise from current position.

5. **"Brother and Sister run as one, their shadows flee the burning sun. Together they move, their path is clear—where will their darkness next appear?"**
   - *Answer:* Clockwise (or next compass positions for both)
   - *Reveals:* Both Brother and Sister's shadows next positions (they start opposite: Brother at South, Sister at West).

**Shouted Riddles (requires Amplifying Stone, information shared with all):**

6. **"NORTH! SOUTH! EAST! WEST! Which direction serves you best?"**
   - *Answer to shout:* [Cardinal direction] (e.g., "EAST!" or "SOUTH!")
   - *Reveals to all:* All shadows' next positions along the clockwise path. Shouting helps allies but also alerts enemies.

7. **"The eldest leads the family dance! Name the guardian's advance!"**
   - *Answer to shout:* "FATHER!" followed by direction (e.g., "FATHER MOVES EAST!")
   - *Reveals to all:* Father's shadow next position. Enemy fire elementals may contest for Father's large shadow.

8. **"When four paths cross and darkness grows, THE FOCAL POINT—where safety flows! Shout the count of rounds until convergence shows!"**
   - *Answer to shout:* "[Number]!" (e.g., "THREE!" or "NOW!")
   - *Reveals to all:* Rounds until focal point convergence. Allies and enemies both rush toward the position.

9. **"Sister's shade moves swift and small! Name her destination—shout it to all!"**
   - *Answer to shout:* [Cardinal/intermediary direction] (e.g., "NORTHWEST!" or "SOUTH!")
   - *Reveals to all:* Sister's shadow next position. Information aids everyone in combat.

10. **"The sphere that rides highest catches first the flame! Shout its direction—win the game!"**
    - *Answer to shout:* [Direction] (e.g., "CLOCKWISE!" or "EAST!")
    - *Reveals to all:* General clockwise rotation direction and Father's specific next position.

**GM Tips for Riddles:**
- Present riddles in dramatic announcer voice or as mystical whispers from the moon-stones.
- **Amplifying Stones glow faintly** when a shouted riddle is posed—players must decide if sharing information is worth alerting enemies.
- Accept creative answers that demonstrate understanding of the shadow mechanic.
- For groups struggling, offer hints after one round: "The answer lies in what you've already seen!"
- Reward especially clever or dramatic answers with +1 [[crowds_favor|Favor]].
- **Track compass positions clearly** on the battle map using N/S/E/W markers.
- When focal point approaches, increase tension: "Three more rounds until the GREAT CONVERGENCE!"
- Enemies react to shouted answers: Fire Elementals may race toward announced positions.
- Mix riddles with standard Arcana checks so players have multiple paths to prediction.

## Enemies (heat-adapted hunters)
- 3 Fire Elementals (CR 5 each; immune to fire, thrive in sunlight, actively push PCs into sun).
- 2 Salamanders (CR 5 each; heat metal weapons, constriction, prefer lurking in shadows to ambush).
- 1 Efreeti Enforcer (CR 11; reduced HP to ~150 for balance; flame-based attacks, gaseous form to reposition, commands the elementals).
- 4 Magma Mephits (CR 1/4 each; swarm tactics, death burst when killed creates brief fire hazards).
- **Flex:** For 4 PCs, remove 1 Fire Elemental and reduce Efreeti HP to 120. For 6 PCs, add 2 more Salamanders and increase Efreeti to full stats.

## Enemy Tactics
- **Fire Elementals:** Grapple PCs and drag them into sunlight; position to block shadow access.
- **Salamanders:** Use *heat metal* on armored PCs to force them to choose between armor and shadow safety.
- **Efreeti:** Stays airborne, uses *wall of fire* to cut off shadow paths; commands elementals to herd PCs.
- **Magma Mephits:** Suicide rush into PC groups in shadows; death burst forces repositioning.

## Crowd Favor Hooks
- Predict shadow movement and position perfectly for next round: +1 [[crowds_favor|Favor]].
- **Use an Amplifying Stone dramatically** (shout a correct answer that helps allies): +2 Favor for showmanship.
- Defeat an enemy while both of you are in direct sunlight (taking damage): +2 Favor for defying the sun.
- **Survive and fight during focal point convergence** (all shadows together): +2 Favor for mastering the convergence.
- Use *heat metal* or fire damage against fire-immune enemies creatively (environmental kills): +2 Favor.
- Survive 3 consecutive rounds in direct sunlight without dropping: +2 Favor for endurance.
- Shove an enemy from shadow into sunlight dramatically: +1 Favor.
- **Solve a riddle correctly and immediately use the knowledge** to save an ally: +2 Favor.
- Kill the Efreeti with a cold-based attack: +3 Favor for ironic justice.

## Hazards and Environment
- **Sunlight Damage:** Constant threat; positioning is survival.
- **Shadow Overlap:** Father's large shadow (40-foot) frequently overlaps with smaller shadows, creating tactical safe zones.
- **Focal Point Convergence:** Every 4 rounds, all shadows converge at the arena center in a 50-foot zone—both PCs and enemies race for this sanctuary.
- **Amplifying Stones:** 3 scattered stones (DC 12 Perception); using one reveals information to enemies too—tactical risk.
- **Heat Metal:** Salamanders force PCs to drop weapons/armor or suffer ongoing damage in addition to sunlight.
- **Wall of Fire:** Efreeti blocks escape routes; Dex save DC 16 or take 5d8 fire damage crossing.
- **Exhaustion:** Prolonged sun exposure weakens PCs (disadvantage on checks, reduced speed).

## Announcer Beats
- Opening: "The sun rises over Tarsus! But this is no gentle dawn—this is the BLAZING JUDGMENT! Watch as Father, Mother, Brother, and Sister dance their deadly circle! Dance with the shadows or BURN!"
- First sunlight damage: "Flesh sizzles! Smoke rises! The gladiator stumbles into the light—WILL THEY RETREAT?!"
- Shadow chase: "Father's shadow moves EAST! The moons turn! Run! RUN! The sun shows no mercy!"
- First Amplifying Stone used: "They've found the stone! The answer ECHOES through the arena! Even the Efreeti hears their secret!"
- Focal point warning: "Two rounds until CONVERGENCE! All shadows become ONE! Will they reach the sanctuary?!"
- Focal point convergence: "THERE! The family reunites! Darkness devours the light! Fight for the FOCAL POINT!"
- Enemy dragged into sunlight: "The Salamander screams! Its own element betrays—NO! It thrives! But the human BURNS!"
- Riddle solved dramatically: "The gladiator shouts 'SOUTH!' and Sister's shadow reveals her path! The crowd knows the secret now!"
- Creative kill: "FROZEN BLADE THROUGH FLAME! The Efreeti's eyes widen—impossible! The crowd ROARS!"
- Victory: "They stand in Father's shadow, triumphant! The sun sets on their enemies! Tarsus has witnessed the dance of survival!"

## GM Tips
- Use physical templates or tokens to show shadow positions clearly with compass directions marked on the map.
- **Use different sized tokens** for Father (largest), Mother (medium), Brother & Sister (smallest) to make tracking intuitive.
- Give PCs one free "shadow position prediction" at start of combat to help them understand the mechanic.
- **Track the focal point cycle visibly**—count down rounds until convergence to build tension.
- Place 3 Amplifying Stones in visible but risky positions (in sunlight or near enemies).
- Narrate heat viscerally: "Your skin blisters," "The air shimmers with killing heat," "Your hair singes."
- When PCs use Amplifying Stones, have enemies react immediately: "The Efreeti turns its head at your shout!"
- Let PCs experiment: "Can I use *control water* to create steam/cover?" (Creative solutions earn Favor).
- Track exhaustion publicly; let players weigh risk vs. reward of staying in sun.
- If a PC drops from heat exhaustion, describe the crowd's reaction—some jeer, some show pity.
- Enemies should actively use the environment; Fire Elementals race toward announced shadow positions.
- At focal point convergence, make it a battle royale moment—everyone fights for the 50-foot safe zone.

## Aftermath Seeds
- Patron interest: Fire cult leader impressed by "sun survival"; offers initiation into flame mysteries (risky power, potential corruption).
- Rumor: The artificial sun is a captured djinn's heart—activist groups plot to free it, arena collapse possible.
- Downtime: Salamander scales can be harvested (resistance to fire damage for 1 hour if crafted into salve, alchemist required, 75 gp cost).
- Injury: PC with severe sunburns develops "Sun-Scarred" trait—disadvantage on Charisma checks due to disfigurement, but advantage on Intimidation vs. fire creatures.
- Political: Rival gladiators accuse PCs of receiving "shadow tips" from arena staff—investigation into cheating allegations.
- Reward: Efreeti's brass chains (can be sold for 200 gp or crafted into *bracers of defense* by skilled smith).
