# The Drowning Clock

## Hook
The arena floor is a massive mechanical clock face. As the battle progresses, each "hour" section floods with alchemical acid. The party must reach the clock's hands—the only safe ground—while fighting enemies who can swim through the corrosive tide.

## Mechanics

### The Clock
- 12 wedge-shaped sections, each 15 ft deep
- Every 2 rounds, the "hour hand" advances: that section floods with green acid
- Acid deals 2d6 acid damage to anyone starting their turn in it (half on DC 13 Con save)
- Clock hands (giant brass structures) rise above the acid—safe platforms but only 10 ft wide each

### The Center
- A 20 ft diameter central hub contains the **Clockwork Heart**
- Destroying the Heart (AC 15, 40 HP) stops the flooding permanently
- Heart is guarded by the **Temporal Gears**—creatures that regenerate unless killed in specific order

### Escape Valves (Puzzle Element)
- Three **Pressure Valves** are scattered on different clock sections
- Each valve requires an action to turn + DC 12 Athletics/Thieves' Tools
- Turning all 3 valves in the CORRECT sequence (1-2-3, hidden in arena inscriptions) drains one flooded section
- Wrong sequence: that valve explodes for 2d8 damage in 10 ft radius

## Enemies
- **2 Acid Mephits** (CR 1/4)—immune to acid, taunt from flooded sections
- **1 Clockwork Horror** (reflavored Bronze Scout, CR 1)—can walk on clock hands
- **1 Corroded Champion** (reflavored Berserker, CR 2, but immune to acid)—former gladiator who "lost" here, now serves the clock

## Environmental Hazards
- **Grinding Gears**: Sections 3 and 9 have exposed gears—DC 13 Dex save or take 1d10 bludgeoning and be restrained
- **Steam Vents**: Section 6 erupts with steam each round—10 ft line, 1d6 fire damage
- **Slick Brass**: Clock hands are difficult terrain unless wearing spiked boots (available at Snak's shop)

## Crowd's Favor Opportunities
- Jump between clock hands as section floods beneath you: Panache roll
- Save an ally from acid by pulling them onto a hand: +2 Favor
- Solve valve puzzle without hints: +2 Favor
- Taunt the Corroded Champion about his past failure: +1 Favor (he rages, disadvantage on attacks for 1 round)
- Destroy Clockwork Heart with a dramatic finishing blow: Panache + 2 Favor

## Scaling
- **3 PCs**: Remove 1 Acid Mephit, Clockwork Heart has 30 HP
- **5 PCs**: Add 1 more Clockwork Horror, flooding advances every 1.5 rounds (use initiative count 15)

## Announcer Beats
- "Tick... tock... the clock cares nothing for glory, only PUNCTUALITY!"
- As first section floods: "Section one is GONE! The green tide rises!"
- If PC falls in acid: "BURNING! Can their allies pull them free before they dissolve?"
- Final section flooding: "The last dry ground! ONE hand remains! WHO WILL CLAIM IT?"

## Aftermath Seeds
- Corroded Champion, if spared, reveals the clock was built by a mad artificer patron—foreshadowing a future BBEG
- Clockwork Heart fragments can be salvaged for 50 gp or crafted into acid-resistant components
- Crowd remembers PCs who saved allies from the acid—reputation boost with common folk patrons
