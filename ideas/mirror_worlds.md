# Mirror Worlds

- **Hook:** The arena splits into parallel dimensions—half the party trapped in each. They can see each other through shimmering barriers but cannot cross or touch. Obstacles in one world can only be solved from the other. Enemies phase between realities. The crowd watches both arenas simultaneously on arcane projection screens—twice the spectacle, twice the wagers.
- **Party:** 4-6 PCs split evenly between Dimension A (Material) and Dimension B (Shadow). Must coordinate actions across the barrier to survive.

## Arena Layout
**Two Identical 60×60-foot Squares (Side by Side Dimensionally):**
- Each dimension mirrors the other's layout but with reversed hazards and enemy positions.
- Transparent arcane barrier runs down the centerline—PCs can see/hear through it but cannot pass or target across it.
- Three pressure plates in each dimension; both sets must be activated simultaneously to unlock gates.
- Four elemental pillars (fire, ice, lightning, acid) in each dimension; activating one pillar in Dimension A affects the OPPOSITE element in Dimension B.

**Key Mechanic—Asymmetric Puzzles:**
- Lever in Dimension A raises a platform in Dimension B (and vice versa).
- Rotating walls in Dimension A create paths in Dimension B; teams must coordinate timing.
- Boss mechanics require damage from both dimensions simultaneously to break immunity shields.

## Split Party Assignment
- GM divides party evenly at start (players can request swaps based on abilities).
- For 4 PCs: 2 in each dimension. For 5 PCs: 2/3 split. For 6 PCs: 3 in each.
- Characters CAN be swapped between dimensions by standing in phase-swap circles (appears at initiative count 10 each round, one per dimension).

## Enemies (phase-walkers)
**Dimension A (Material):**
- 2 Phase Spiders (CR 3; can shift to Dimension B as action, become incorporeal).
- 1 Invisible Stalker (CR 6; harasses ranged attackers, uses invisibility to confuse).
- 3 Shadow Mastiffs (CR 2; trip attacks, pack tactics).

**Dimension B (Shadow):**
- 2 Spectral Warriors (reskin Wraiths, CR 5; drain life, phase to Dimension A to attack).
- 1 Nightmare (CR 3; trampling charges, ethereal stride between dimensions).
- 3 Dark Creepers (CR 1/2; explode on death, create obscuring smoke).

**Shared Boss - Echo Lich (CR 9-equivalent):**
- Splits between dimensions; immune to damage unless attacked in BOTH dimensions within same round.
- Casts *dimension door* to swap between arenas; PCs must track which dimension it occupies.
- Uses *mirror image* reflecting across barrier—false images appear in opposite dimension.
- When bloodied, merges into one dimension; other dimension fills with shadowy minions (4 Shadows, CR 1/2).

**Flex:** For 4 PCs, remove Invisible Stalker and reduce Shadow Mastiffs/Dark Creepers to 2 each. For 6 PCs, add 1 Oni (CR 7) that randomly phases between dimensions.

## Coordination Mechanics (Mandatory)
**Pressure Plates:**
- Three in each dimension must be held down simultaneously (requires 6 creatures total, 3 per dimension).
- When all plates active for 1 full round, gates open to safe extraction zone (escape route if overwhelmed).
- Enemies do NOT trigger plates; only PCs and environmental objects (crates, barrels, summons).

**Elemental Pillars:**
- Fire pillar in A creates ice hazard in B (and vice versa): 20-foot square difficult terrain, 2d6 cold damage on entry.
- Ice pillar in A creates fire hazard in B: 20-foot square flames, 2d6 fire damage per turn.
- Lightning pillar in A electrifies water in B (10-foot puddles become 3d6 lightning, Dex DC 14).
- Acid pillar in A corrodes platforms in B (5-foot squares collapse, creating 10-foot pit hazards).

**Echo Lich Vulnerability:**
- Must take damage in BOTH dimensions within same round to bypass immunity.
- Teams must coordinate: "On my mark—NOW!" Requires called shots and readied actions.
- When immunity breaks, Echo Lich is vulnerable until start of next round (take full damage).

## Objectives
- **Primary:** Defeat Echo Lich by coordinating cross-dimensional damage.
- **Secondary:** Activate all pressure plates at least once (demonstrates mastery of cooperation).
- **Bonus:** Complete fight with both dimensions maintaining at least half their PCs conscious.

## Crowd Favor Hooks
- Successfully coordinate simultaneous damage on Echo Lich to break immunity: +2 [[crowds_favor|Favor]] to both attackers.
- Activate an elemental pillar that saves a PC in the other dimension from hazard: +2 Favor to activator.
- Hold pressure plate while under attack to help other dimension: +1 Favor for sacrifice play.
- Use phase-swap circle to rescue endangered teammate in other dimension: +2 Favor.
- Call out enemy position in your dimension to help other team prepare: +1 Favor for scouting (DM discretion).
- [[panache|Panache]] strike that kills phasing enemy mid-transition: +3 Favor for timing.
- Both dimensions execute synchronized [[panache|Panache]] strikes simultaneously: +4 Favor split among participants.
- Solve elemental pillar puzzle chain (activate 3+ pillars in coordinated sequence): +2 Favor to masterminds.

## Phase Combat
- Phasing enemies appear as translucent in dimension they're not currently in; can be seen but not targeted.
- Echo Lich phases every 2 rounds; PCs must track and communicate: "It's in B now! My turn to damage!"
- Phase Spiders use hit-and-run tactics; attack in A, phase to B, return next round.
- Teams can call out enemy phase patterns to coordinate ambushes: "It's coming to you next—ready actions!"

## Announcer Beats
- Opening: "TWO ARENAS! ONE DESTINY! Our champions are SPLIT! Can they fight as one—or perish divided?!"
- First pressure plate activation: "COORDINATION! The plates respond! Can they hold under fire?!"
- Echo Lich immunity break: "THE SHIELDS SHATTER! Strike as one across the VOID!"
- Pillar chain reaction: "Fire becomes ice! Ice becomes lightning! ELEMENTAL MASTERY!"
- Phase-swap dramatic save: "A LEAP THROUGH REALITY! They abandon their dimension to save their brother!"
- Echo Lich merge: "The Lich UNIFIES! Now one arena faces the full fury!"
- Victory: "THEY BEND DIMENSIONS TO THEIR WILL! The Echo Lich FALLS! Tarsus witnesses LEGENDARY cooperation!"

## GM Tips
- Use two battlemaps side-by-side or VTT layers to represent dimensions clearly.
- Encourage VOICE communication; this is the core "It Takes Two" experience—constant callouts.
- Mark which dimension each enemy is currently in with tokens or color coding.
- Let teams develop hand signals or shorthand: "Fire A!" = "Activate fire pillar in Dimension A!"
- Echo Lich immunity is the core challenge; remind players it requires damage in BOTH dimensions within same round.
- Readied actions are essential; teach players to coordinate: "I ready my attack for when you hit it."
- If teams struggle with coordination, let announcer give "hints" via crowd reactions: "The crowd points at the pillar!"
- Phase-swap circles let teams adapt if one dimension is overwhelmed; encourage creative swapping.
- Track pressure plates visually (light up when held); creates tangible goal beyond combat.
- Elemental pillar effects should be dramatic and visible; narrate the cross-dimensional consequences vividly.

## Aftermath Seeds
- **Dimensional Echoes:** PCs who participated gain "Echo-Touched" trait: advantage on saves vs. teleportation/dimensional effects.
- **Patron Interest:** Arcane academy fascinated by dimensional coordination; offers sponsorship for further experiments (risky contracts).
- **Rumor:** The barrier magic was stolen from ancient elven prison system—someone is reverse-engineering planar bindings.
- **Injury:** PC who phase-swapped multiple times develops minor "dimensional instability": occasionally flickers translucent for 1d4 seconds (cosmetic).
- **Political:** Crowd's dual-screen viewing experience becomes a trend; other arenas copy the format, creating rivalry over "who did it first."
- **Downtime:** Dimensional coordination training available; teams can practice for +1 bonus to cooperative mechanics in future split scenarios.
- **Legendary Moment:** If teams executed perfect Echo Lich immunity break 3+ times, crowd erupts; patrons commission bronze statues of the paired strikers.
