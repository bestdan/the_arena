# The Architect's Gambit

## Hook
The arena floor is a giant magical chessboard. The party are the "pieces"—but they don't know the rules until they learn them the hard way. An invisible Architect calls out moves, and the party must deduce the pattern while fighting constructs that DO know the rules.

## The Board
- 8x8 grid of 10 ft squares, alternating white and black marble
- Party starts on one edge, enemy constructs on the opposite
- Certain squares glow faintly—stepping on them triggers effects

### Square Effects (revealed through play)
- **Red Glow**: Damage square—2d6 fire damage on entry
- **Blue Glow**: Slow square—speed halved until end of next turn
- **Gold Glow**: Blessing square—+1d6 to next attack roll
- **No Glow**: Safe (most squares)

## The Rules (Party Must Deduce)
The Architect announces cryptic "rules" each round. The party must figure out what they mean:

### Round 1: "Knights leap, pawns crawl"
- Moving exactly 3 squares in an L-shape = no opportunity attacks
- Moving only 1 square = +2 AC until start of next turn

### Round 3: "Bishops see diagonals"
- Moving diagonally = advantage on next attack
- Moving in straight lines = disadvantage on next attack

### Round 5: "Rooks command the row"
- Moving in a straight line across 4+ squares = can push one creature 10 ft

### Rule Violation
- Breaking the current rule = 1d8 force damage (the board punishes ignorance)
- Constructs NEVER break rules—watching them reveals the pattern

## Enemies
- **2 Pawn Constructs** (Animated Armor, CR 1)—only ever move 1-2 squares, attack adjacent only
- **1 Knight Construct** (reflavored Helmed Horror, CR 4)—always moves in L-shapes, charges with lance
- **1 Bishop Construct** (reflavored Animated Armor with ranged attack)—moves diagonally, fires force bolts

### Construct Behavior
- They telegraph their moves—DM describes them "aligning" before moving
- Party can predict moves by watching constructs and deducing rules

## Puzzle Element: Checkmate
- The **Architect's Throne** sits on the opposite edge (the "king" square)
- Reaching the throne with a PC ends the game—but the throne square is surrounded by traps
- Traps deactivate if the party "calls" the correct move pattern before moving ("I move like a knight!")

## Crowd's Favor Opportunities
- Correctly deduce a rule before it's revealed: +2 Favor
- Panache when moving in a dramatic chess-like pattern
- "Checkmate" the Architect's throne in style: +3 Favor
- Take damage from breaking a rule but shrug it off: +1 Favor (crowd respects learning the hard way)

## Scaling
- **3 PCs**: 1 Pawn, 1 Knight (no Bishop)
- **5 PCs**: 3 Pawns, 1 Knight, 1 Bishop

## Announcer Beats
- "The Architect's board awaits! Our gladiators are PIECES in a game they don't yet understand!"
- When party breaks a rule: "OOH! The board BITES! Perhaps next time, OBSERVE!"
- When party deduces a rule: "They've CRACKED IT! The Architect's smile fades!"
- Checkmate: "CHECKMATE! The student has BEATEN the master!"

## The Architect (Voice Only)
- Never visible—echoing voice from above
- Sounds amused by mistakes, impressed by deductions
- If party struggles, offers cryptic hints ("Watch how my knight dances...")
- Potential recurring antagonist—patron of games and wagers

## Aftermath Seeds
- Architect offers patronage to clever gladiators—future downtime: puzzle challenges for gold
- Knight Construct's lance is salvageable (magical weapon, +1)
- Crowd remembers who learned fastest—reputation as "the clever ones" opens doors with scholar patrons
