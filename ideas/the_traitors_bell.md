# The Traitor's Bell

## Hook
A massive bronze bell hangs at the arena's center. The crowd knows one gladiator has been secretly cursed—marked by the Patron of Whispers. That gladiator doesn't know they're marked. The bell will reveal the truth... eventually.

## The Twist
**One random PC receives a secret curse** (whispered by DM before combat). They don't know what it does. Every 3 rounds, the bell tolls and reveals a cryptic clue about who carries the curse. The curse activates on round 9 unless the party solves it.

### Curse Effects (roll d4):
1. **Bloodlink**: When cursed PC takes damage, nearest ally takes half
2. **Reversed Fortune**: Cursed PC's healing damages instead
3. **Shadow Puppet**: On round 9, cursed PC attacks closest ally (charmed, 1 round)
4. **Mana Drain**: Each spell cast by cursed PC gives enemies +1d6 temp HP

### Bell Clues (each toll):
- Round 3: "The marked one has touched steel today" (attacked with weapon) or "...has not"
- Round 6: "The marked one's blood runs [hot/cold]" (HP above/below half)
- Round 9: Curse activates if not cleansed

## Arena Layout
- Central bell (30 ft tall) with cleansing runes at base
- Four **Accusation Pedestals** around perimeter—party can "accuse" a PC by placing their token
- Correct accusation before round 9 = curse transfers to nearest enemy
- Wrong accusation = accuser takes 3d6 psychic damage

## Enemies
- **3-4 Whispering Shades** (reflavored Shadows, CR 1/2)—they know who's cursed, taunt wrong guesses
- **1 Bell Keeper** (reflavored Cult Fanatic, CR 2)—tries to protect the bell, can toll it early for 2d8 thunder damage in 20 ft radius

## Crowd's Favor Opportunities
- Correctly deduce the cursed PC before round 6: +2 Favor
- Panache when making an accusation (dramatic speech): standard roll
- Cleanse the curse by having the marked PC voluntarily step onto pedestal: +3 Favor (requires self-awareness)
- Wrong accusation with dramatic confidence: crowd loves the chaos, +1 Favor anyway

## Scaling
- **3 PCs**: 2 Shades, Bell Keeper has 20 HP
- **5 PCs**: 4 Shades, add 1 Shade Lieutenant (Shadow with pack tactics)

## Announcer Beats
- "The Bell knows secrets, friends! But do THEY know themselves?"
- After wrong accusation: "Oh, the CONFIDENCE! The DRAMA! Wrong, but MAGNIFICENT!"
- If party figures it out early: "Remarkable! They've cracked the curse—but can they survive the Keeper's wrath?"

## GM Tips
The cursed player should genuinely not know—hand them a folded note that says "You feel normal. Act normally." The real curse note goes to no one visible; the tension of not knowing IS the mechanic. If players metagame by asking "did you get a note?", have all players receive identical folded notes.
