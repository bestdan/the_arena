# Shared Spark

- **Hook:** Ritual magic binds the party's life force into a single shared pool. All damage spreads across the entire team; all healing benefits everyone. Spellcasters draw from a communal mana well—when one casts, all feel the drain. Ultimate resource management meets forced cooperation. The crowd watches the mystical tether glow brighter with each shared wound, each collective spell. Will unity make them invincible—or will one weak link doom them all?
- **Party:** 4-6 PCs. All share HP pool, spell slots, and hit dice. Cooperation is survival.

## Arena Layout
- 100×100-foot open courtyard with four elemental shrines (Fire, Water, Earth, Air) at cardinal points.
- Central ritual circle (20-foot diameter) where the Shared Spark manifests as glowing nexus.
- Each shrine can be activated (bonus action, any PC within 5 feet) to grant temporary benefits to entire team.
- Scattered pillars provide cover but no safe zones; enemies spawn from perimeter gates.

## Shared Resources Mechanic (Revolutionary Teamwork)
**Combined HP Pool:**
- Add all PC max HP together into single pool (e.g., 4 PCs with 40, 35, 45, 38 HP = 158 total).
- ANY damage to ANY PC reduces the shared pool.
- When pool reaches 0, ALL PCs fall unconscious simultaneously.
- Death saves are INDIVIDUAL (each unconscious PC rolls separately; 3 failures = that PC dies permanently).

**Communal Spell Slots:**
- Pool all spell slots together by level (e.g., if party has 4 1st-level slots, 3 2nd-level, etc., all share this pool).
- ANY spellcaster can draw from ANY slot level until pool depletes.
- Coordination required: "I'm using a 2nd-level slot for *hold person*—we have 2 left!"
- Cantrips unaffected (free casting).

**Shared Hit Dice:**
- Pool all hit dice together (note dice types: d8, d10, d12, etc.).
- Short rest healing draws from communal pool; any PC can roll any available die.
- Depletion risk: if all dice used early, no healing options remain.

**Damage Distribution:**
- Narrative flexibility: damage "spreads" across tether—all PCs wince/stagger when any takes hit.
- Mechanical tracking: simply reduce shared HP pool total.
- If specific PC is focus-fired (3+ attacks in one round), that PC takes visible scarring/bruising (narrative only).

## Enemies (resource drainers)
**Attrition Specialists:**
- 3 Vampiric Assassins (reskin Assassins, CR 8; deal damage and heal themselves for half, prolonging fight).
- 2 Spell Thieves (reskin Mages, CR 6; *counterspell* attempts to waste party's spell slots).
- 4 Necrotic Leeches (custom, CR 3; attach and drain 1d6 HP per round from shared pool until removed, DC 13 Strength).
- 1 Arcane Devourer (reskin Invisible Stalker, CR 6; attacks spellcasters specifically, forcing defensive spell usage).

**Final Boss - Harvester Construct (CR 11-equivalent):**
- Mechanical monstrosity designed to drain shared pools.
- **Mana Siphon:** Bonus action, forces party to sacrifice 1 spell slot (highest level available) or take 3d8 psychic damage to shared pool.
- **Life Tap:** Legendary action (1/round), drains 2d10 from shared HP pool, heals Construct for same amount.
- **Overload Pulse:** Recharge 5-6, 30-foot cone, 6d6 force damage to shared pool, DC 16 Dex save for half.
- Defeated only by depleting its HP (120) while managing party's shared resources carefully.

**Flex:** For 4 PCs, remove 1 Vampiric Assassin and 2 Necrotic Leeches. For 6 PCs, add 1 more Spell Thief and upgrade Harvester Construct HP to 150.

## Shrine Bonuses (Team Buffs)
**Activating a shrine consumes 1 bonus action from any PC within 5 feet. Effect lasts 3 rounds.**

- **Fire Shrine:** Shared pool gains resistance to fire damage; all melee attacks deal +1d6 fire.
- **Water Shrine:** Shared pool regenerates 2d6 HP per round (total, distributed narratively).
- **Earth Shrine:** Shared pool gains +10 temporary HP (absorbs damage before touching real pool).
- **Air Shrine:** All PCs gain +10 movement speed and advantage on Dexterity saves.

**Cooldown:** Each shrine can only be activated once per 5 rounds (track carefully).

## Cooperation Requirements
**Communication is Critical:**
- "I'm casting *fireball*, that's our last 3rd-level slot!"
- "Don't heal yet—save hit dice for when we're lower!"
- "Activate Water Shrine NOW—we're bleeding out!"

**Resource Budgeting:**
- Spellcasters must coordinate spell slot usage: "Save counterspell for the boss!"
- Healing decisions are team-wide: "Do we risk short rest or push through?"
- Shrine activation requires tactical timing: "Save Fire Shrine for when we face the boss!"

**Risk Sharing:**
- Tanky PC stepping forward protects others indirectly (all share damage anyway, but drawing aggro prevents squishier PCs from being targeted).
- Squishy PC dying depletes group's offensive power; everyone invested in everyone's survival.

## Objectives
- **Primary:** Defeat Harvester Construct without depleting shared HP pool to 0.
- **Secondary:** Preserve at least 3 spell slot levels (any combination) by end of fight.
- **Bonus:** Complete fight without any PC rolling death saves (+3 [[crowds_favor|Favor]] to all).

## Crowd Favor Hooks
- Coordinate to activate shrine at clutch moment (prevents TPK): +2 Favor to activator.
- Spellcaster sacrifices high-level slot for defensive spell that saves team: +2 Favor.
- Entire party survives Harvester's Overload Pulse via coordinated Dex saves (all succeed): +3 Favor to all.
- PC uses [[panache|Panache]] healing spell to dramatically recover shared pool: +2 Favor.
- Defeat Vampiric Assassin before it can heal (prevent resource drain): +2 Favor to killer.
- Remove all Necrotic Leeches within 2 rounds (efficient cleansing): +1 Favor to team.
- Finish fight with 50+ HP in shared pool remaining (excellent resource management): +2 Favor to all.
- Execute perfect counterspell to save party's spell slot from Spell Thief: +2 Favor.

## Harvester Tactics
- **Phase 1 (HP 120-80):** Focuses on Mana Siphon, forcing spell slot depletion.
- **Phase 2 (HP 79-40):** Activates Life Tap frequently, draining HP while self-healing.
- **Phase 3 (HP 39-0):** Spams Overload Pulse, attempting burst damage to finish shared pool.
- Targets spellcasters preferentially (knows they're key to party's resource strategy).

## Announcer Beats
- Opening: "ONE POOL! ONE FATE! The Shared Spark ignites! Unity or ANNIHILATION!"
- First major damage: "They ALL stagger! The pain is SHARED! Can they endure as one?!"
- Mana Siphon activation: "The Harvester DRAINS their magic! Resources dwindle!"
- Shrine activation: "The shrine ANSWERS! Power flows to the tether!"
- Shared pool below 50%: "The Spark DIMS! Can they rally before it FADES?!"
- Death save situation: "ONE FALLS! But the others FEEL it! The bond tightens!"
- Victory: "The Harvester COLLAPSES! The Shared Spark ENDURES! Unity conquers all!"

## GM Tips
- Track shared HP pool on large, visible tracker (whiteboard, index card, digital counter).
- Announce spell slot usage loudly: "That's your last 2nd-level slot—choose wisely!"
- Encourage team discussions mid-combat: "Should we short rest now or push through?"
- Harvester's Mana Siphon creates brutal choices: lose slot or take damage? Both hurt!
- Let PCs feel vulnerability; ONE bad round of focus-fire could doom everyone.
- Shrine activation should feel impactful; narrate glowing tether brightening, wounds closing simultaneously.
- If team struggles with resource management, let announcer "accidentally" drop hint: "Perhaps the shrines hold answers?"
- Track individual death saves separately even though HP is shared; creates tense moments.
- Emphasize shared suffering: "You ALL wince as the blade strikes your companion!"
- Let team develop slang: "Burn a slot" = use spell slot, "Tap the pool" = short rest, etc.

## Aftermath Seeds
- **Sympathetic Link:** PCs occasionally feel phantom pains when separated post-fight (cosmetic, fades after days).
- **Patron Interest:** Arcane college fascinated by ritual's stability; offers research sponsorship (risky experiments on life-binding magic).
- **Rumor:** Shared Spark ritual was ancient war magic—used to bind squadrons so no soldier would abandon injured comrades.
- **Injury:** PC who fell unconscious during fight develops "Echo Scar": mark on chest that glows faintly when other party members are hurt (cosmetic).
- **Legendary Moment:** If team finished with 50+ HP and 3+ spell slots, crowd commissions artwork: single glowing sphere with all PCs' silhouettes merged.
- **Political:** Arena masters debate ethics of Shared Spark events—some say it's "too cruel," others demand more.
- **Downtime:** Resource coordination training available; team can practice shared management for bonuses in future pooled-resource scenarios.
- **Equipment:** Harvester's core can be salvaged; artificer can craft "Harmonic Amulet" (rare, attunement): wearer can transfer up to 10 HP to adjacent ally once per long rest.
