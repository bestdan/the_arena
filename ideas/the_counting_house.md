# The Counting House

## Hook
A wealthy merchant patron has set up a twisted game: the arena floor displays numbers, and the gladiators must stand on tiles that add up to specific totals while fighting. Correct math = rewards. Wrong math = punishment. Combat and arithmetic collide.

## The Number Grid
- Arena floor is a 6x6 grid of large tiles, each displaying a number (1-9)
- Numbers are arranged pseudo-randomly but ensure at least 3 valid solutions per puzzle
- Current "target sum" is displayed on a massive counting board overhead

### Puzzle Mechanic
Every 3 rounds, a new target sum is announced (between 10 and 30).
- **PCs must position themselves** so the sum of all tiles they occupy equals the target
- All PCs MUST be on numbered tiles when the count happens (end of round 3, 6, 9...)
- They have until the announcement to get into position

### Outcomes
- **Correct Sum**: All PCs gain +1d6 temp HP, enemies take 1d6 force damage, +1 Favor
- **Off by 1-2**: Nothing happens (neutral)
- **Off by 3+**: All PCs take 1d6 force damage, enemies are healed 1d6
- **Exact Sum with Panache** (all PCs shout the sum theatrically): +2 Favor bonus

## Arena Layout
- 6x6 numbered grid (30 ft x 30 ft)
- **Merchant's Balcony** (above)—patron watches, can throw coins (gold AND traps)
- **Four Counting Pillars** (corners)—display running PC position total (helps with math)
- **Zero Tile** (center)—worth 0, but standing here means you don't count toward sum
- **Neutral Walkways** between tiles—doesn't count as a number, but enemies can occupy

## Enemies
- **3 Coin Golems** (reskinned Animated Armor, CR 1)—made of coins, explode on death (1d6 in 5 ft)
- **1 Debt Collector** (reskinned Thug, CR 1/2)—shouts wrong numbers to confuse, carries a ledger that tracks PC positions
- **1 Abacus Construct** (reskinned Spectator but no eye rays, CR 2)—floats overhead, blasts PCs who are in "wrong" positions with force bolts

### Abacus Construct Behavior
- Knows the target sum
- Targets PCs whose current tile makes the sum impossible
- If all PCs are in valid positions, attacks the PC on the highest number (greed = pride)

## Crowd's Favor Opportunities
- Solve puzzle first try with exact sum: +2 Favor
- Panache when calling out your number ("I AM THE FOUR!")
- Knock an enemy onto a tile that would ruin your sum, then defeat them before count: +1 Favor
- Complete puzzle while standing on Zero tile (contribution without counting): +1 Favor (crowd loves irony)
- Solve puzzle with the minimum number of PCs (2 PCs = target, others on Zero): +1 Favor (efficiency)

## Puzzle Examples
Target Sum: 15 with 4 PCs
- Valid: 3 + 4 + 5 + 3 = 15
- Valid: 7 + 2 + 4 + 2 = 15
- Invalid: 6 + 6 + 2 + 2 = 16

## Scaling
- **3 PCs**: Target sums are 8-20 (easier math), 2 Coin Golems
- **5 PCs**: Target sums are 15-35, 4 Coin Golems, Abacus Construct has advantage on attacks

## Environmental Hazards
- **Merchant's Coins**: Every 2 rounds, patron throws 2d10 gp onto random tiles—grabbing them takes an action (greed vs. positioning)
- **Trap Coins**: 1 in 4 thrown coins are explosive (1d6 fire damage when picked up)
- **Sliding Tiles**: Round 6+, some tiles slide when stepped on (DC 12 Dex or slide 1 tile in random direction)

## Announcer Beats
- "Welcome to the COUNTING HOUSE! Today's game: MATH... or DEATH!"
- Target announced: "The sum is TWENTY-THREE! Position yourselves, gladiators!"
- Correct sum: "CORRECT! The merchant SMILES! Your reward is VIGOR!"
- Wrong sum: "WRONG! The numbers PUNISH! Did you forget to CARRY THE ONE?"
- Perfect Panache solve: "THEATRICAL! They SANG their numbers! The crowd ROARS!"

## Merchant Patron (Balcony)
- Rotund, golden robes, counts on an abacus constantly
- Cheers for correct answers, boos for wrong ones
- If impressed: offers future patronage (access to economic advantages, rare items)
- If bored: threatens to add multiplication next time

## GM Tips
- Prepare 4-5 target sums in advance with 2-3 valid PC arrangements each
- Write tile numbers on paper and let players physically position tokens
- Don't rush math—give players 30 real-world seconds to discuss
- If players hate math, have the Debt Collector accidentally shout hints ("NOT the seven!")

## Aftermath Seeds
- Coin Golem debris = 50 gp in scattered coins (but must be collected mid-combat or enemies grab them)
- Merchant patron Goldsworth the Exacting becomes recurring challenge-setter
- Abacus Construct's core can be repurposed—creates item that grants +2 to Investigation checks
- Party known as "The Calculating Killers" or similar math-pun nickname
