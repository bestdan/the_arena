# Riddle of the Four Gates

- **Hook:** Four elemental gates ring the arena's center, each sealed by ancient magic. Cryptic riddles carved in stone hint at which gate holds the true exit. Choose wrong, and face elemental wrath. Choose wisely, and prove your mind sharp as your blade. The crowd watches—who will solve the puzzle first?
- **Party:** 4-6 PCs, level 5+. Emphasize elemental interaction, riddle-solving, and managing multiple threats simultaneously.

## Arena Layout

- **Central Plaza** (50-foot diameter octagonal platform)—PCs start here, elevated 5 feet above the arena floor.
- **Four Gates** positioned at cardinal directions, each 15 feet tall and carved from elemental stone:
  - **North Gate (Ice)** - frosted blue crystal, mist rolling from its surface.
  - **East Gate (Fire)** - obsidian with veins of lava, radiating heat.
  - **South Gate (Earth)** - granite and moss, vines coiling around frame.
  - **West Gate (Air)** - alabaster white, wind howling through carved runes.
- **Elemental Fonts** - four small fountains in the Central Plaza, one for each element (ice water, eternal flame, growing moss, swirling wind). PCs can interact with these to gather "elemental keys."
- **Master Riddle Stone** - central pillar in the plaza with the primary riddle inscribed.
- Each gate has a **secondary chamber** (20x20 feet) beyond it with element-themed hazards and a guardian.

## Master Riddle (Central Pillar)

The pillar reads:

*"Four gates stand, four elements wait,*  
*One truth opens freedom's gate.*  
*Fire consumes, Ice preserves,*  
*Earth endures, Air swerves.*  
*Seek the gate that changes not,*  
*Where foundation holds the lot."*

**Solution Hint:** The riddle points to **Earth/South Gate** ("foundation holds," "endures," "changes not"). Earth is the element of permanence and stability—the correct path.

## Gate-Specific Riddles

Each gate has an additional riddle carved into its frame. These provide **misdirection** or **confirmation** depending on interpretation.

### North Gate (Ice) - **FALSE PATH**

*"I hold what fire cannot keep,*  
*In my embrace, memories sleep.*  
*Eternal, unchanging, forever still—*  
*Choose me to escape death's chill."*

**Interpretation:** Ice "preserves" but also "freezes" progress—not the true path. The riddle is designed to mislead by emphasizing "eternal" and "unchanging."

### East Gate (Fire) - **FALSE PATH**

*"I illuminate the darkest way,*  
*Transform the night into the day.*  
*Without me, cold and hunger reign—*  
*Choose me to break your chain."*

**Interpretation:** Fire "illuminates" and "transforms," suggesting enlightenment, but it also "consumes"—not stable enough for true freedom.

### South Gate (Earth) - **CORRECT PATH**

*"I am the ground beneath your feet,*  
*The mountain where the sky and stone meet.*  
*I change not with the passing years—*  
*Choose me to conquer all your fears."*

**Interpretation:** Earth is the **foundation**, the stable element. "I change not with the passing years" echoes the Master Riddle's "changes not." This is the correct gate.

### West Gate (Air) - **FALSE PATH**

*"I carry words across the land,*  
*No wall or chain can make me stand.*  
*Freedom is my very name—*  
*Choose me to win this game."*

**Interpretation:** Air represents "freedom" literally, making it the most tempting false answer. But air is ever-changing, not stable—fails the Master Riddle's test.

## Elemental Font Clue System

The four fonts in the Central Plaza provide **physical clues**:

- **Ice Font:** Touching it freezes a PC's hand for 1 round (no damage, just uncomfortable). The ice forms a pattern showing a labyrinth with **no exit**.
- **Fire Font:** Reaching into the flame (1d4 fire damage) reveals ash that forms words: "Bright but brief."
- **Earth Font:** Digging into the moss-covered earth reveals a **stone key** with the inscription "Foundation." (**Strongest clue**)
- **Air Font:** Placing a hand in the swirling wind causes it to whisper: "I am everywhere and nowhere." (Misdirection—air cannot be pinned down)

**Investigation DC 13** on the Earth Font reveals ancient dwarven runes meaning "bedrock" and "permanence."

## Gate Challenges

PCs can attempt gates in any order. Entering a gate teleports the PC(s) to its secondary chamber; the gate remains open but is one-way unless the challenge is completed.

### North Gate (Ice Chamber) - **FALSE PATH**

**Environment:** Room is frozen (difficult terrain). Temperature is -20°F; PCs without cold resistance take 1d4 cold damage at the start of each turn.

**Puzzle:** A frozen statue of a previous gladiator holds a **crystal orb**. An inscription reads: *"Thaw the past to find your path."*

**Solution:** PCs must carefully melt the ice (fire spells, torches) without shattering the statue (AC 10, 15 HP; if destroyed, puzzle fails). Successfully freeing the orb reveals an inscription inside: "You have chosen frost—frost chooses death."

**Consequence:** The orb activates a **blizzard** in the Central Plaza (20-foot radius, heavily obscured, 2d6 cold damage per round to creatures inside, lasts 4 rounds).

**Guardian:** 1 **Ice Mephit** (CR 1/2) emerges from the statue when disturbed. If PCs persist, 2 **Winter Wolves** (CR 3 each) phase through the walls on Round 3.

### East Gate (Fire Chamber) - **FALSE PATH**

**Environment:** Floor is superheated stone (1d6 fire damage per round unless hovering/protected). Braziers line the walls, creating bright light and smoke (lightly obscured).

**Puzzle:** A massive bronze bell hangs from the ceiling with a riddle etched on it: *"Strike me thrice to hear the truth."*

**Solution:** Ringing the bell three times (requires reaching it—10 feet overhead, Athletics DC 14 or ranged attack) causes it to resonate. The sound forms words: "Fire lights the way, but smoke blinds the fool."

**Consequence:** The bell's resonance shatters the braziers, causing a **firestorm** in the Central Plaza (15-foot radius, 4d6 fire damage, Dex save DC 15 for half, lasts 2 rounds).

**Guardian:** 1 **Fire Elemental** (CR 5, reduced HP to 60) emerges from the braziers when the bell is struck the second time. If defeated, it explodes (2d6 fire damage in 10-foot radius).

### South Gate (Earth Chamber) - **CORRECT PATH**

**Environment:** Solid stone room with roots growing through cracks. Stable, quiet, calm. No hazards.

**Puzzle:** A stone altar holds a clay tablet inscribed with: *"Press your hand to the foundation. Swear your oath to stand."*

**Solution:** A PC must place their hand on the altar and speak an oath of resilience or defiance (player choice—roleplay moment). The altar glows green and a **keystone** materializes.

**Consequence:** Inserting the keystone into the South Gate (back in Central Plaza) causes the gate to open fully, revealing the **exit passage** glowing with golden light. All PCs can pass through to freedom.

**Guardian:** 1 **Earth Elemental** (CR 5, reduced HP to 80) emerges from the floor but is **non-hostile** unless attacked. If spoken to (Persuasion DC 12), it says: "You have chosen well. The earth endures." It then returns to the floor peacefully.

**Success:** The correct path. No combat required if PCs roleplay the oath and don't attack the guardian.

### West Gate (Air Chamber) - **FALSE PATH**

**Environment:** Room has no floor—just a 30-foot-deep pit with swirling winds. PCs must fly or float to survive (or fall and take 3d6 bludgeoning damage).

**Puzzle:** Floating platforms (5 feet diameter, 5 apart) drift slowly. A scroll hovers in the center, held by wind currents. Retrieving it requires Acrobatics DC 15 to jump between platforms or magical flight.

**Solution:** The scroll reads: *"Freedom is the wind—untethered, ungrasped, unattained."* It dissolves after being read.

**Consequence:** The winds intensify, creating a **whirlwind** in the Central Plaza (20-foot-radius cylinder, 3d6 bludgeoning damage, Strength save DC 14 or be knocked prone and pushed 15 feet, lasts 3 rounds).

**Guardian:** 1 **Air Elemental** (CR 5) forms from the swirling winds when the scroll is touched. It attacks relentlessly, using whirlwind to knock PCs off platforms.

## Time Pressure

- **Round 5:** The Central Plaza begins to **sink slowly** into the arena floor (1 foot per round). By Round 15 (10 feet deep), it's 10 feet below the gates, making re-entry difficult (requires climbing, Athletics DC 13).
- **Round 10:** If no correct gate has been opened, a **Xorn** (CR 5) burrows up through the Central Plaza floor, attacking indiscriminately.
- **Round 12:** All false gates begin to **seal permanently**—if PCs are still in a false chamber, they have 2 rounds to escape or be trapped (teleport out or break the gate, AC 15, 100 HP).

## Enemies and Flex Scaling

### 4 PCs
- Reduce Earth Elemental to CR 4 (HP 60).
- Remove Xorn; replace with 2 **Gargoyles** (CR 2 each) that attack on Round 10.
- Reduce Fire Elemental to CR 4 (HP 50).

### 5-6 PCs
- Use full stat blocks as written.
- Add 1 **Dao** (CR 11, reduced HP to 100) that appears in Central Plaza on Round 8 if PCs have attempted 2+ false gates. It mocks their failures and attacks.

## Crowd Favor Hooks

- Solve the Master Riddle without attempting any false gates: +4 [[crowds_favor|Favor]].
- Interact with all four Elemental Fonts before choosing a gate: +2 Favor for thoroughness.
- Convince the Earth Elemental to assist or acknowledge the PCs: +2 Favor for wisdom.
- Survive a false gate's consequence (blizzard/firestorm/whirlwind) without anyone dropping to 0 HP: +1 Favor per gate.
- Speak a meaningful oath at the South Gate altar with [[panache|Panache]]: +2 Favor for drama.
- Open the correct gate before Round 8: +2 Favor for speed.

## Announcer Beats

- Opening: "FOUR GATES! FOUR ELEMENTS! Which holds freedom? Which holds DOOM? The riddle awaits!"
- First gate entered: "They choose the [North/East/South/West]! Confidence or folly? The crowd leans forward!"
- False gate consequence: "ICE STORM! / FIRESTORM! / WHIRLWIND! The elements PUNISH their hubris!"
- Correct gate opened: "THE EARTH GATE OPENS! The foundation holds! They've solved the riddle! GENIUS OR LUCK?"
- Xorn appears: "STONE ITSELF REBELS! A creature of earth emerges—FIGHT OR FLEE!"
- Victory: "They walk the path of the foundation! THE RIDDLE IS SOLVED! Tarsus celebrates WISDOM!"

## GM Tips

- **Riddle Handouts:** Print the Master Riddle and gate-specific riddles for players to reference and debate.
- **Elemental Interaction:** Encourage creative use of fonts (collecting samples, experimenting). Reward experimentation with flavor descriptions.
- **False Path Consequences:** Make consequences scary but survivable. They're punishments, not TPKs.
- **Earth Guardian Roleplay:** If PCs approach the South Gate peacefully, have the Earth Elemental act as a wise guardian, approving their choice. This rewards non-combat solutions.
- **Time Pressure Balance:** If PCs are genuinely stuck, have the crowd chant hints ("THE GROUND BENEATH!" "FOUNDATION!") or the announcer drop clues.
- **Visual Aids:** Use colored tokens or markers for the four fonts. Let players physically manipulate them to represent collecting elemental samples.
- **Split Party Risk:** If PCs split to explore multiple gates simultaneously, run encounters in parallel—creates tension and coordination challenges.

## Aftermath Seeds

- **Patron Interest:** Elemental cult impressed by PC's respect for earth magic; offers training in geomancy or earth-based spells.
- **Rumor:** The arena's elemental gates were built by a long-dead archmage who hid treasure in the true path's chamber. PCs could return during downtime to explore.
- **Downtime:** The **keystone** from the South Gate can be kept as a trophy. It functions as a **Stone of Good Luck** but only for the PC who spoke the oath.
- **Injury:** PC burned by the Fire Font or caught in the firestorm develops minor scarring (cosmetic, but could use in roleplay).
- **Political:** Elemental merchants offer to sponsor PCs in future bouts if they endorse earth-based goods (armor, weapons).
- **Loot:** Inside the South Gate's chamber (if PCs search thoroughly, Investigation DC 15), they find an **Elemental Gem (Earth)** worth 500 gp.
