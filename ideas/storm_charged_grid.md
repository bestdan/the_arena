# Storm-Charged Grid

- **Hook:** "Dance between the lightning!" The arena floor is a metal grid connected to arcane storm generators. Every few seconds, sections of the grid surge with deadly electricity. Gladiators must predict and avoid the surges while fighting, moving constantly to stay ahead of the crackling death beneath their feet.
- **Party:** 4-6 PCs, level 7+. Emphasizes pattern recognition, timing, and mobility under electrical pressure.

## Arena Layout
- Square arena (100 feet × 100 feet) with metal floor divided into 25 sections (20-foot squares in 5×5 grid).
- **Grid Sections:** Each section labeled (A1-E5 for GM tracking). Metal plates conduct electricity.
- **Storm Generators:** Four tesla coil towers in arena corners (40 feet tall) crackle with energy.
- **Insulated Platforms:** 4 small raised stone platforms (10-foot square each) scattered across arena—safe from electricity but exposed.
- **Surge Pattern:** Sections activate in rotating pattern (or semi-random for chaos).

## Lightning Surge Mechanic
- **Initiative Count 20:** 1d4+2 grid sections activate (surge with electricity for 6 seconds/1 round).
- **Surge Damage:** Creatures starting turn on active section take 4d10 lightning damage (Dex save DC 16 half).
- **Conductive Metal:** Creatures wearing metal armor have disadvantage on the save.
- **Chaining:** If creature takes damage from surge while adjacent to another creature, lightning arcs (second creature takes 2d10 lightning, Dex save DC 14 half).
- **Pattern Prediction:** Intelligence (Arcana) check DC 13 to predict which sections will activate next round (gives 1 round warning).

## Surge Patterns (GM Options)
- **Option 1 - Rotating Pattern:** Sections activate in clockwise spiral from center outward (predictable once observed).
- **Option 2 - Random Chaos:** Roll 1d25 to determine which sections activate (unpredictable, higher tension).
- **Option 3 - Player-Triggered:** Sections activate based on combat movement (heavy traffic areas surge next round).

## Enemies (electricity-immune constructs and aberrations)
- 3 Lightning Elementals (reskin Air Elementals, CR 5 each; immune to lightning, fly speed, whirlwind ability).
- 2 Helmed Horrors (CR 4 each; flying constructs, magic resistance, immune to lightning, force PCs onto active grids).
- 1 Chain Devil (CR 8; reduced HP to ~100 for balance; chain attacks grapple and position PCs, animate chains ability).
- 4 Spark Mephits (reskin Smoke Mephits, CR 1/4; death burst deals lightning in 5-foot radius, suicide tactics).
- **Flex:** For 4 PCs, remove 1 Lightning Elemental and the Chain Devil. For 6 PCs, add 1 more Helmed Horror and upgrade Chain Devil to full stats.

## Enemy Tactics
- **Lightning Elementals:** Grapple PCs and drag them onto active sections; immune to surge damage makes them fearless.
- **Helmed Horrors:** Shove PCs onto active grids; fly above to avoid surges; focus fire on metal-armored PCs.
- **Chain Devil:** Uses chains to grapple and pull PCs across multiple grid sections; positions itself on inactive sections.
- **Spark Mephits:** Swarm PCs on active sections; death burst adds lightning damage (stacks with surge).

## Crowd Favor Hooks
- Successfully predict surge pattern 3 rounds in a row: +2 [[crowds_favor_mechanic|Favor]] for mastery.
- Defeat an enemy while standing on an active section (taking surge damage): +2 Favor for reckless bravery.
- Push/grapple an enemy onto an active section using Shove or spell: +2 Favor for tactical electrocution.
- Never step on an active section throughout entire fight: +3 Favor for perfect footwork.
- Redirect lightning damage using metal object or spell (creative use of environment): +2 Favor for ingenuity.
- Kill the Chain Devil while grappled by its chains: +2 Favor for breaking free dramatically.
- Save an ally from active section by pulling them to safety: +1 Favor for teamwork.

## Hazards and Environment
- **Lightning Surges:** Constant repositioning required; standing still = risk death.
- **Metal Armor Penalty:** Heavy armor wearers at severe disadvantage; may need to doff armor mid-combat (dramatic choice).
- **Chain Lightning:** Clustering creates chain damage risk; forces PCs to spread out.
- **Insulated Platforms:** Safe but exposed; limited space creates chokepoints and targeting opportunities.
- **Tesla Coil Towers:** Can be attacked (AC 15, 50 HP each); destroying one reduces surge frequency (1d4+1 sections instead of 1d4+2).

## Announcer Beats
- Opening: "WITNESS THE STORM-CHARGED GRID! Lightning beneath their feet! Will they dance—or FRY?!"
- First surge: "SECTION C-3 LIGHTS UP! Electricity roars! He LEAPS—just in time!"
- PC electrocuted: "CAUGHT IN THE SURGE! Hair stands on end! Smoke rises! Can they endure?!"
- Enemy electrocuted: "The Helmed Horror hovers above—but its ally is FRIED! Friendly fire!"
- Pattern prediction: "She KNOWS where it will strike! She moves before the lightning! BRILLIANT!"
- Chain lightning: "ARC! ARC! The lightning jumps between them! TWO FALL!"
- Victory: "They stand on dead sections! The storm quiets! Masters of the grid!"

## GM Tips
- Pre-determine surge pattern or roll randomly—communicate whichever method to build trust.
- Use colored tokens or light-up indicators on grid to show active sections (visual clarity critical).
- Give PCs 1 free Arcana check at start to understand pattern (teaching moment).
- Remind players about metal armor disadvantage—creates dramatic armor-doffing moments.
- Enemies should actively herd PCs into surges; Lightning Elementals grapple and hold them in place.
- Narrate electricity viscerally: "Sparks fly," "Your teeth chatter," "Smell of ozone and burned flesh."
- Let creative solutions shine: *absorb elements*, *shocking grasp* redirected, *mage hand* to trigger traps.
- If pattern is predictable, PCs can master it—reward strategic thinking with Favor.

## Aftermath Seeds
- Patron interest: Arcane engineer impressed by "pattern recognition"; offers job maintaining storm generators (well-paid, risky).
- Rumor: The tesla coils are powered by captured storm spirits—activist group plots to free them (arena chaos).
- Downtime: Lightning Elemental core can be harvested (crafted into *wand of lightning bolts* by artificer, 500 gp cost).
- Injury: PC electrocuted 5+ times develops "Electric Scars"—glowing Lichtenberg figures on skin, advantage on Intimidation but disadvantage on Stealth.
- Political: Rival gladiators accuse PCs of knowing surge pattern in advance—investigation into arena corruption.
- Reward: Chain Devil's chains (can be sold for 250 gp or worn as *+1 whip* with 10-foot reach and grapple ability).
