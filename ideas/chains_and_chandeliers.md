# Chains and Chandeliers

- **Hook:** Senate demands spectacle; announcer promises "a dance of iron and fire."
- **Arena Layout:** Circular floor with four suspended iron chandeliers on chains. Pulleys let creatures climb or drop them. Central brazier ring throws light smoke; falling chandeliers create 10-foot fire bursts and lingering embers (difficult terrain).

## Encounter (4-6 PCs, mid-tier low level)
- 2 Veteran shield-duelists on the floor.
- 3 Scouts on catwalks with fire arrows.
- 1 Mage bound with a detonation collar scripted to explode a chandelier at 50% HP.
- **Flex:** For 4 PCs, remove 1 Scout and downgrade duelists to Guards. For 6 PCs, add 1 Berserker who drops from a chandelier.
