# The Shepherd's Debt

## Hook
A shepherd from the provinces sold himself to the arena to pay his village's debts. His flock of six enchanted sheep were thrown in with him—and now the party must protect both the shepherd AND his sheep while wolves hunt them across a maze of hedgerows.

## The Catch
The sheep aren't helpless—each one carries a magical blessing. If a sheep survives, that blessing transfers to a PC at battle's end. If a sheep dies, that blessing goes to the lead wolf, making the final fight harder.

## The Sheep & Their Blessings
1. **Woolsworth** (white wool): +5 temp HP at dawn for 1 day
2. **Bramble** (thorny wool): Next attack that hits you deals 1d4 piercing back
3. **Ember** (reddish wool): Resistance to fire for 1 hour
4. **Mist** (grey wool): Advantage on Stealth for 1 hour
5. **Clover** (four-leaf pattern): Re-roll one failed save today
6. **Midnight** (black wool): See in magical darkness for 1 hour

## Arena Layout
- 60 x 60 ft hedge maze with 10 ft tall walls (climbable, DC 12)
- Shepherd starts in center with sheep clustered around him
- Party enters from one corner, wolves enter from all four corners
- Four **Shepherd's Gates**—if the shepherd reaches any gate with at least 3 sheep, immediate victory (but fewer blessings)

### Hidden Elements
- **Wolf Den**: One dead-end contains wolf pups—killing them enrages the Alpha (+2 damage, advantage on attacks)
- **Shepherd's Crook**: Hidden in a hedge nook—gives shepherd ability to command sheep to move 30 ft as bonus action
- **Healing Spring**: One intersection has a small spring—1d8 healing, one use per creature

## Enemies
- **4 Wolves** (CR 1/4)—standard pack tactics, target sheep first
- **1 Alpha Wolf** (Dire Wolf stats, CR 1)—appears round 3 from the direction with most sheep

### Wolf Behavior
- Wolves prioritize isolated sheep
- If a PC protects a sheep (within 5 ft), wolves test with one attack then seek easier prey
- Alpha goes for the shepherd directly

## Crowd's Favor Opportunities
- Dramatically shield a sheep from a wolf attack: Panache roll
- Shepherd survives with all 6 sheep: +3 Favor (crowd loves an underdog)
- Kill the Alpha Wolf in front of the shepherd: +2 Favor
- Find and spare the wolf pups: Split crowd—+1 Favor from nobles, -1 from commoners
- Shepherd dies but sheep survive: +1 Favor (tragic, but the flock endures)

## Scaling
- **3 PCs**: 3 Wolves, Alpha appears round 4
- **5 PCs**: 5 Wolves, add 1 more Alpha Wolf (pack of two)

## The Shepherd (Commoner Stats)
- **HP**: 8
- **AC**: 10
- **Speed**: 25 ft (won't leave sheep behind)
- **Motivation**: Protect his flock; will sacrifice himself for them
- **Voice**: "They're all I have left. My village depends on their wool."

## Announcer Beats
- "The shepherd and his flock face the fangs of the wild! Can our gladiators play SHEEPDOG?"
- When a sheep falls: "MUTTON! The crowd WINCES! That's one blessing lost!"
- If shepherd finds his crook: "The old man remembers his trade! Those sheep MOVE!"
- All sheep survive: "SIX BLESSINGS! This shepherd chose his champions WELL!"

## Aftermath Seeds
- Shepherd offers to work in the gladiator camp—potential downtime NPC who provides minor buffs
- If Midnight survives, rumors spread of a "dark wool" that grants shadow-sight—black market interest
- Wolf Alpha's pelt is valuable (25 gp) but wearing it marks you as "wolf-killer" to certain beast-aligned patrons
