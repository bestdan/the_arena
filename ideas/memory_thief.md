# The Memory Thief

- **Hook:** An enchanter's curse strips gladiators of their memories—their names, their skills, their very identities. Scattered across the arena are memory fragments (glowing orbs). Reclaim your past while shadowy echoes of forgotten foes hunt you. Remember who you are—or be lost forever.
- **Party:** 4-6 PCs, level 4+. Emphasize roleplaying identity loss, skill recovery, and psychological tension.

## Arena Layout
- Fog-shrouded arena (120x120 feet) with **Memory Fragments** (12 glowing orbs) scattered at key locations.
- Terrain: broken statues (cover, remnants of forgotten champions), shallow pools (reflect distorted images), crumbling pillars.
- **Memory Altar** at arena center (stone dais, 10-foot diameter)—final ritual site to restore full memories.
- Crowd watches via scrying; they remember the gladiators even if the gladiators don't remember themselves.

## Core Mechanic: Memory Loss
At the bout's start, all PCs suffer **The Forgetting Curse**:
- PCs lose all **memory of who they are**: names, backgrounds, personal history erased.
- PCs **retain mechanical abilities** (class features, spells, attacks) but **don't remember how they learned them** ("I know how to cast *fireball*... but why?").
- **No meta-knowledge:** Players can't reference past sessions, NPC relationships, or campaign history until memories are restored.

### Memory Fragments
12 **Memory Orbs** are scattered across the arena. Each orb contains a **fragment of a PC's identity**:
- **Name Orb** (1 per PC): Restores PC's name.
- **Skill Orb** (1 per PC): Restores proficiency in one skill (player chooses which skill they "remember").
- **Bond Orb** (shared): Restores memory of an ally ("I know you! You're my friend!").
- **Purpose Orb** (shared): Restores why they're fighting ("We're gladiators! We fight for freedom!").

### Collecting Fragments
- PCs must physically touch an orb to absorb it (free action).
- Upon absorption, DM narrates a **memory flash** (describe a vivid moment from PC's past).
- Example: "You see a face—your sister's face. She's crying. You promised to come back."

### Full Restoration
- Once all PCs collect at least **3 fragments each**, they can perform a **Restoration Ritual** at the Memory Altar.
- Ritual requires **1 minute** (10 rounds) of concentration (all PCs must participate; interruptions reset progress).
- Upon completion, all memories fully restore; curse ends.

## Enemies (Forgotten Echoes)
Shadowy manifestations of **foes the PCs have forgotten**—echoes of past enemies, twisted by the curse.

### 4 PCs
- 4 **Shade Echoes** (use Shadow, CR 1/2; represent forgotten enemies; whisper taunts PCs don't recognize).
- 2 **Hollow Champions** (use Wight, CR 3; former gladiators lost to the curse; attack mindlessly).

### 5 PCs
- 5 Shade Echoes.
- 3 Hollow Champions.

### 6 PCs
- 6 Shade Echoes.
- 3 Hollow Champions.
- Add 1 **Oblivion Wraith** (use Wraith, CR 5; drains memories further—on hit, target must drop one Memory Orb if carrying any).

### Enemy Tactics
- **Shade Echoes** whisper forgotten grudges ("You left me to die!" "You broke your promise!"); PCs don't remember context (unnerving).
- **Hollow Champions** attack with mechanical precision; no emotion, no tactics—just hollow aggression.
- **Oblivion Wraith** (if present) targets PCs with most Memory Orbs; tries to steal fragments (Life Drain forces orb drop on hit, save DC 14 negates).

## Objectives
- **Primary:** Collect enough Memory Fragments (3+ per PC) to perform Restoration Ritual at Memory Altar.
- **Secondary:** Survive Forgotten Echoes (enemies punish PCs who linger or split up).
- **Tertiary:** Complete Restoration Ritual without interruption (bonus Favor for smooth ritual).

## Tactical Elements
- **Identity Search:** PCs explore arena seeking orbs; each orb reveals piece of who they are (name, skill, bond, purpose).
- **Roleplaying Disorientation:** Players should act confused, uncertain; "Do I know you?" "Why am I holding this sword?"
- **Memory Priority:** Some orbs more valuable than others (Name Orbs = critical; Skill Orbs = useful).
- **Ritual Protection:** During Restoration Ritual, PCs are vulnerable (can't move, can't attack); must defend each other.
- **Forgotten Tactics:** PCs may not remember team strategies; force players to rediscover cooperation.

## Hazards and Twists
- **Memory Drain Zones:** Certain areas (marked by dark fog) drain memories further—PCs inside must make Wisdom save DC 13 or lose a Memory Orb they're carrying (drops to ground).
- **False Memories:** 2-3 orbs are **corrupted** (fake memories planted by enchanter); absorbing one grants false identity (DM narrates false flashback; player must realize it's wrong via Insight DC 15).
- **Echo Recognition:** Sometimes a Shade Echo looks familiar (represents a real NPC from campaign); PC can try to remember (Intelligence DC 14) and gain clue about past.
- **Altar Guardians:** When PCs approach Memory Altar, 2 **Hollow Champions** activate and attack (defending the altar from "thieves").
- **Round 8 Twist:** Enchanter appears (hologram) and taunts: "You'll never remember! Give up and I'll end your suffering!" (psychological pressure).

## Crowd Favor Hooks
- First PC to collect a Memory Orb: +1 [[crowds_favor|Favor]].
- Collect all 3 required fragments before any ally: +1 Favor for speed.
- Protect an ally during Restoration Ritual (take damage defending them): +2 Favor.
- Defeat a Forgotten Echo with [[panaches|Panache]] while still memory-less: +2 Favor for instinct.
- Recognize a Shade Echo as a past enemy (successful Intelligence check): +1 Favor for clarity.
- Complete Restoration Ritual without interruption: +3 Favor.
- Roleplay disorientation convincingly (DM's judgment): +1 Favor.

## Announcer Beats
- Opening: "The curse takes hold! They stand confused—strangers to themselves! **Can they reclaim what was stolen?!**"
- First orb collected: "A spark! A flicker of memory! They begin to remember!"
- False memory absorbed: "Wait—something's wrong! That memory **lies!** Will they realize in time?!"
- Ritual begins: "They gather at the altar! Ten heartbeats to restoration—**but the shadows close in!**"
- Ritual interrupted: "NO! The ritual breaks! They must start again! Desperation mounts!"
- Full restoration: "THEY REMEMBER! Names, faces, purpose—**all restored!** The curse shatters! Tarsus roars for the mind victorious!"

## GM Tips
- **Pre-Session Prep:** Prepare Memory Orb descriptions for each PC (name, skill, bond, purpose). Write vivid flashbacks.
- **Encourage Disorientation Roleplay:** Remind players their PCs don't remember past sessions. "Do I know you?" "Why am I here?"
- **Memory Flashbacks:** When PC absorbs orb, narrate vivid, emotional memory (sister's face, mentor's lesson, first kill, moment of freedom).
- **False Memories:** Plant 2-3 fake orbs; descriptions sound plausible but don't match PC's real history (e.g., "You remember serving the King"—but PC was a street urchin).
- **Shade Echo Taunts:** Use real campaign NPCs PCs have wronged or lost; echoes whisper their grievances (even though PCs don't remember).
- **Ritual Tension:** During Restoration Ritual, describe progress vividly ("Round 2: Images flicker... Round 5: Faces solidify... Round 9: Almost there..."). Make interruptions costly.
- **Memory Drain Zones:** Mark dark fog areas visibly; PCs who enter must save or drop orb (creates risk vs. reward for shortcuts).
- **Oblivion Wraith Threat:** If present, narrate it as "the ultimate forgetting"—PCs who see it feel dread (Wisdom save DC 12 or frightened for 1 round).

## Aftermath Seeds
- **Patron Interest:** Mind mage impressed by PC's resilience; offers training in mental defenses or memory magic.
- **Rumor:** The enchanter who cursed them is still at large; patrons seek gladiators to hunt them down.
- **Downtime:** PC who collected the most Memory Orbs gains **Clarity of Mind** (advantage on Intelligence saves for 1 week).
- **Injury:** PC who absorbed a false memory suffers **Lingering Doubt** (disadvantage on Insight checks for 1d4 days; can be removed via *greater restoration*).
- **Political:** Crowd debates which PC showed strongest identity ("The one who never forgot their name!" vs. "The one who fought without needing to remember!"). Patron sponsorship influenced by crowd opinion.
- **Loot:** Memory Orbs (if not all used) can be sold as **Mnemonic Crystals** (store one memory; replay later; 50 gp each; collectors prize them).
