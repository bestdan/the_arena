# Crimson Waltz

- **Hook:** A vampire lord from old Tarsus nobility claims ancient arena rights—"first blood to first death." The crowd whispers as midnight descends and crimson eyes gleam. Dance with death... or become it.
- **Party:** 4-6 PCs, level 9-11. Charm effects, regeneration, and tactical minion control dominate.

## Arena Layout
- Gothic ballroom aesthetic (100-foot square)—marble floor, chandelier hanging at center (20 feet up, can be dropped as hazard).
- Four blood fountains (corners)—vampire can spend bonus action to drain (heal 3d8), but doing so costs 1 spawn vampire.
- Velvet curtains along walls provide concealment; vampire can Hide (bonus action) and reappear elsewhere (quasi-teleport flavor).
- Moonlight beams (initiative 15): three 10-foot diameter spotlights sweep floor in waltz pattern; vampire in moonlight takes 2d6 radiant per round (no save).

## Enemies (vampire aristocrat plus thralls)
- 1 **Vampire** (CR 13)—uses charm, legendary actions, and shapeshifting tactically. Cannot enter moonlight willingly.
- 3 **Vampire Spawn** (CR 5)—loyal thralls, grapple PCs and drag toward vampire for feeding.
- 6 **Zombies** (CR 1/4) in noble attire—shamble from curtains, provide fodder and crowd aesthetics.
- **Flex:** For 4 PCs, reduce to 2 Vampire Spawn and 4 Zombies; vampire starts bloodied (70 HP). For 6 PCs, add 1 additional Vampire Spawn and upgrade zombies to **Ghouls** (CR 1).

## Vampire Tactics (Waltz Phases)
- **Opening (Overture):** Vampire charms most charismatic PC (Wisdom save DC 17), commands them to attack allies. Spawn advance to screen.
- **Mid-Fight (Crescendo):** Uses legendary actions to move without provoking, bites grappled PCs (2d6+4 piercing + 3d6 necrotic, max HP reduction). Drains blood fountain if wounded.
- **Bloodied (half HP, Climax):** Shapeshifts to bat swarm, flees into curtains, reappears with surprise attack. Uses *children of the night* to summon 2d4 rat swarms or 1d4 wolf packs (DM choice).
- **Critical (30 HP, Finale):** Desperation—attempts to charm entire party (mass charm, Wisdom DC 17, can charm multiple targets) or gaseous form escape to coffin (hidden beneath arena, requires investigation to find).

## Crowd Favor Hooks
- Breaking vampire's charm on ally (successful saving throw or *lesser restoration*): +2 Favor.
- Forcing vampire into moonlight beam (shove, grapple, or spell): +3 Favor.
- Dropping chandelier on vampire (ranged attack vs. AC 12 to break chain, then Dex save DC 15 or 4d10 bludgeoning + pinned): +3 Favor.
- Destroying all 4 blood fountains before vampire can drain any: +4 Favor (party-wide).
- Using [[panache]] to "cut in" and waltz with vampire before striking: +3 Favor on success (Performance check DC 16).

## Hazards and Vampire Vulnerabilities
- **Moonlight beams:** Sweep in predictable waltz pattern (1-2-3, 1-2-3 count); PCs can predict and herd vampire.
- **Blood fountains:** Provide vampire healing but reducing them limits options. Can be poisoned (alchemist's supplies DC 15) to deal 2d6 poison on drain.
- **Coffin retreat:** If vampire reaches 0 HP without staking/sunlight, gaseous form escapes to hidden coffin; must be found (Investigation DC 18) and staked (action, DC 16 Strength to drive stake).
- **Charm immunity:** creatures immune to charm (some races/spells) can anchor party and break charm on others.

## Announcer Beats
- Opening: "SILENCE, TARSUS. The Crimson Lord graces us—this is not mere blood sport, this is... the WALTZ OF DEATH."
- First charm: "Look! The gladiator turns on their comrades—will they break the spell or fall to betrayal?"
- Vampire into moonlight: "THE LIGHT! The vampire BURNS in holy radiance! Drive them into the beams!"
- Vampire bloodied: "First blood! But the night is YOUNG—can they finish what they've started?"
- Finale: "THE STAKE IS DRIVEN! Dust and ash—Tarsus is FREE of the crimson curse!" (victory) or "Eternal night falls... the vampire claims new thralls..." (defeat).

## GM Tips
- Vampire should be theatrical: "Come, dance with me." "Your blood sings sweetly." "Join me in eternity, mortals."
- Charm is powerful—telegraph with eye contact, hypnotic voice, crowd murmuring ("Don't look in its eyes!").
- Moonlight beams provide counter-pressure—PCs must coordinate to herd vampire while avoiding spawn.
- If vampire escapes to coffin, create tense chase sequence—timer before it regenerates fully (5 rounds).
- Use [[last_stand]] when charmed PC breaks free just before killing ally—heroic self-sacrifice to stake vampire instead.
- Emphasize gothic horror: flowing capes, dramatic poses, blood-red aesthetics. Crowd initially enthralled, then horrified.

## Aftermath Seeds
- Victory: Vampire's coffin contains *Ring of Regeneration*, *Cloak of the Bat*, and noble deed to estate (political intrigue hook).
- Defeat: PCs turned into vampire spawn; rescue quest by surviving party members or NPC allies. One PC may become full vampire (alignment shift, power/curse).
- Spawn survivors: Some vampire spawn flee; hunt them down (side quest) or they terrorize Tarsus nights.
- Thrall gratitude: Freed zombies were nobles' relatives—families offer rewards, titles, or patronage.
- Vampire legacy: If staked properly, vampire destroyed; if escaped, becomes recurring nemesis with vendetta.
- Hidden crypt: Vampire's lair beneath arena holds more thralls, treasure, and dark secrets about Tarsus history.
