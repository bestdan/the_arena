# Titan's Gauntlet

- **Hook:** A bound titan—chained by ancient gods, now arena spectacle—breaks one shackle. The crowd evacuates upper tiers as the earth trembles. Stop the titan before the second chain shatters and Tarsus falls.
- **Party:** 4-6 PCs, level 12-14. Epic-tier combat, environmental destruction, and race-against-time pressure.

## Arena Layout
- Massive colosseum (200-foot diameter)—titan stands 40 feet tall, chained at center by two godforged chains (AC 20, 100 HP each, immune to non-magical damage).
- Crumbling pillars (8 total, 30 feet tall)—titan's movements shake them; Dex save DC 13 or take 3d10 bludgeoning from falling debris each round titan acts.
- Siege ballistae (4 emplacements at cardinal points)—crewed by arena guards (NPC support), fire giant-slaying bolts (+8 to hit, 4d12 piercing, 3 bolts each).
- Chasm forming (initiative 15): titan's struggle cracks floor; new fissures appear (10-foot wide, 40-foot deep), requiring jump (Athletics DC 15) or fall.

## Enemies (titan awakening plus elemental guardians)
- 1 **Empyrean** (CR 23, weakened to CR 18 by chains)—titan uses maul slams, *earthquake* tremors, and divine rage. While chained, cannot move more than 40 feet from center.
- 4 **Stone Golems** (CR 10)—titan's jailers, turned to titan's side when chain broke. Advance on PCs to prevent chain-destruction.
- 2 **Earth Elementals** (CR 5)—emerge from cracked floor, harass ranged attackers.
- **Flex:** For 4 PCs, reduce to CR 15 titan (use Storm Giant stats with legendary actions), 2 Stone Golems, 1 Earth Elemental; both chains start weakened (50 HP each instead of 100). For 6 PCs, upgrade to full CR 23 Empyrean (higher AC and HP) with standard 2 chains but add 2 more Stone Golems.

## Titan Phases (Awakening Fury)
- **Phase 1 (Chained):** Titan uses maul (reach 20 feet) on nearest PCs; Stone Golems form defensive ring around chains. Roars cause fear aura (30 feet, Wisdom DC 18 or frightened).
- **Phase 2 (One Chain Broken):** Titan gains legendary actions (can slam twice per round between PC turns). Uses *earthquake* variant—entire arena shakes, all creatures make DC 16 Dex save or prone + 4d6 bludgeoning.
- **Phase 3 (Both Chains Broken, ESCAPE):** Titan free—attempts to stride out of arena (will crush city). PCs have 3 rounds to bring to 0 HP or city falls. Titan uses *divine smite* on each attack (additional 6d8 radiant).

## Crowd Favor Hooks
- Destroying a godforged chain under titan's attack: +4 Favor (requires 100 damage while surviving titan's reach).
- Manning siege ballista and landing hit on titan: +2 Favor per hit.
- Surviving titan's maul slam at point-blank range (taking damage but staying conscious): +3 Favor.
- Using [[panache_mechanics]] to climb titan and attack weak point (eyes, joints): +4 Favor on success (Athletics DC 20 to climb, advantage on attacks while mounted).
- Preventing titan escape in Phase 3 final round: +5 Favor (party-wide, "SAVIORS OF TARSUS").

## Hazards and Titan Weaknesses
- **Godforged chains:** Require magical damage or siege weapons to damage. PCs can coordinate ballista strikes (NPC crews assist, PCs aim for +4 bonus).
- **Falling pillars:** Can be toppled onto titan (Athletics DC 18, 6d10 bludgeoning) or Stone Golems (4d10).
- **Chasms:** Provide cover but risk falls; titan's *earthquake* widens them (10 feet per round).
- **Titan's eyes:** Called shots (disadvantage on attack) deal double damage if hit (Dex-based attacks preferred).
- **Stone Golem vulnerability:** Thunder damage bypasses immunity (cracks stone).

## Announcer Beats
- Opening: "THE TITAN STIRS! Tarsus itself TREMBLES—chain the beast or we ALL FALL!"
- First chain breaks: "NO! ONE CHAIN SHATTERS! The gods help us—STOP IT BEFORE THE SECOND BREAKS!"
- Phase 2 earthquake: "THE ARENA CRACKS! Is this the END?!"
- Final phase: "THREE ROUNDS! THREE ROUNDS UNTIL THE TITAN IS FREE! EVERYTHING YOU HAVE—NOW!"
- Finale: "CHAINED AGAIN! Tarsus stands—thanks to these HEROES!" (victory) or "RUN! THE TITAN WALKS! TARSUS FALLS!" (defeat, city evacuation).

## GM Tips
- Titan should feel overwhelming—describe each slam as "earth-shaking," crowd screaming, arena buckling.
- Use time pressure in Phase 3—count down rounds aloud ("Two rounds until the titan escapes!").
- Stone Golems should prioritize defending chains, not attacking PCs—creates tactical choice (engage golems or risk chain).
- Let NPC ballista crews help—PCs can coordinate ("Fire on my mark!") for combined damage.
- Use [[last_stand]] in Phase 3—one PC holds titan's foot to prevent escape, dies heroically while party lands final blow.
- Consider environmental storytelling: crowd fleeing, nobles shouting orders, guards readying evacuation.

## Aftermath Seeds
- Victory: Titan re-chained (or slain); PCs hailed as city saviors. Titles, estates, and political power granted.
- Loot: Fragment of godforged chain (magic item: *Chain of Binding*—can cast *hold monster* at will but requires attunement and DC 20 Strength to wield).
- Defeat: Titan escapes; Tarsus partially destroyed. PCs blamed or exiled; must quest to find gods' weapon to recapture titan.
- Titan's plea: If spared, titan offers knowledge ("I can teach you to fight GODS.") or warns of greater threat ("The chains weaken everywhere...").
- Divine response: Gods observe PC performance—offer celestial boons, quests, or recruit for divine war.
- Arena destroyed: Future sessions in "Ruins of the Colosseum" with titan-shaped crater and unstable terrain.
