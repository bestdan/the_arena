# The Sacrifice Altar

- **Hook:** Five colored altars ring the arena, each demanding a specific sacrifice to grant the party powerful boons. Blood Altar wants HP. Memory Altar erases a skill proficiency. Treasure Altar consumes all gold. Time Altar ages you. Bond Altar severs a friendship. But boons stack—and the final boss scales with how many sacrifices you REFUSE. Will they pay the price for power, or face an unkillable horror with their principles intact?
- **Party:** 3-5 PCs. Tests moral choices under pressure, resource sacrifice, and team consensus. The ultimate "power at a price" dilemma where refusing to sacrifice makes combat harder but preserves identity.

## Arena Layout

- Pentagonal arena (100 feet diameter) with five altars positioned at each point of the pentagon (20 feet from center).
- **The Altars:** Each 10 feet tall, carved from element-specific materials, glowing with magical energy.
  - **Blood Altar (North):** Crimson stone, dripping with blood, demands HP sacrifice.
  - **Memory Altar (Northeast):** Silver crystal, swirling with fog, demands skill/memory erasure.
  - **Treasure Altar (Southeast):** Golden pedestal, coin slots, demands all carried gold.
  - **Time Altar (Southwest):** Ancient bronze hourglass, sand flows upward, demands aging.
  - **Bond Altar (Northwest):** Obsidian heart, cracked, demands severing of emotional connection.
- **Central Platform:** 30-foot-diameter raised stone disc (5 feet high) where final boss spawns after PCs make (or refuse) sacrifices.
- **Altar Activation:** PC must touch altar and verbally accept sacrifice (action). Effect is immediate and cannot be undone except by powerful magic (*greater restoration*, *wish*, etc.).

## The Five Sacrifices (Boons vs. Consequences)

### Blood Altar (HP Sacrifice)
**Demand:** "Give your life force. Bleed for power."
- PC must sacrifice **half their current HP** (rounded up, cannot be healed until combat ends).
- **Boon Granted:** Party gains **Blood Empowerment**—all attacks deal +2d6 necrotic damage for rest of combat.
- **Boss Consequence (if refused):** Boss gains regeneration 10 HP/round (can only be stopped by radiant damage).

### Memory Altar (Skill Sacrifice)
**Demand:** "Forget who you were. Embrace ignorance."
- PC must lose **one skill proficiency** (player choice) permanently until *greater restoration* cast.
- **Boon Granted:** Party gains **Clarity of Purpose**—advantage on all attack rolls for rest of combat.
- **Boss Consequence (if refused):** Boss gains **+4 AC** (pristine scales, impenetrable armor).

### Treasure Altar (Gold Sacrifice)
**Demand:** "Wealth means nothing. Surrender it all."
- PC must sacrifice **all gold pieces currently carried** (drops into altar, consumed).
- **Boon Granted:** Party gains **Golden Blessing**—resistance to all damage types for rest of combat.
- **Boss Consequence (if refused):** Boss summons 4 **Golden Golems** (CR 2 each; immune to non-magical attacks, multiattack) as reinforcements.

### Time Altar (Aging Sacrifice)
**Demand:** "Time takes from all. Give years freely."
- PC must age **10 years** instantly (cosmetic: gray hair, wrinkles, slower reflexes—Dexterity -1 permanently until *greater restoration*).
- **Boon Granted:** Party gains **Timeless Vigor**—advantage on all saving throws for rest of combat.
- **Boss Consequence (if refused):** Boss gains **Legendary Actions** (3 per round, can multiattack, cast spells, or move).

### Bond Altar (Friendship Sacrifice)
**Demand:** "Love weakens you. Sever the ties that bind."
- PC must choose one party member—cannot voluntarily aid them (spells, Help action, healing, etc.) for **7 days** (curse persists after combat).
- **Boon Granted:** Party gains **Lone Wolf Power**—all damage rolls maximized (no need to roll, treat all dice as max value) for rest of combat.
- **Boss Consequence (if refused):** Boss gains **Pack Tactics**—advantage on all attack rolls (its minions surround it, creating constant advantage).

## Decision Phase (First 3 Rounds)

**Rounds 1-3: Exploration and Choice**
- Combat hasn't started yet—arena is empty except for altars.
- PCs can examine altars (DC 12 Arcana reveals what each demands and grants).
- Party must DISCUSS and DECIDE which altars to activate (if any).
- **Time Pressure:** At initiative count 15 each round, announcer counts down: "TWO MINUTES REMAIN! CHOOSE!" (creates urgency).
- After Round 3 (or when party declares "we're ready"), boss spawns at center platform.

**Unanimous Consent Required:**
- Activating altar affects ENTIRE PARTY (boons are shared).
- But individual PC makes sacrifice (one PC bleeds, one PC loses gold, etc.).
- Party must agree who sacrifices what—negotiations happen in real-time.

## The Adapting Boss: The Executioner

**Base Stats (if all 5 altars activated/all sacrifices made):**
- **The Executioner** (CR 6; humanoid construct, heavily armored, greataxe wielder)
- **AC:** 14 | **HP:** 100 | **Speed:** 30 feet
- **Multiattack:** Two greataxe attacks (+6 to hit, 2d12+4 slashing each).
- **Abilities:** Str 18, Dex 10, Con 16, Int 8, Wis 12, Cha 6
- **Resistances:** None (base form is beatable but tough).
- **Tactics:** Straightforward melee combatant, targets closest PC.

**Escalating Power (for each altar NOT activated):**
- **0 Sacrifices (all altars refused):** Boss becomes **The Unkillable Executioner** (CR 12):
  - AC 18 (+4 from Memory)
  - HP 100 + regeneration 10/round (from Blood)
  - Advantage on all attacks (from Bond)
  - Legendary Actions (from Time)
  - Summons 4 Golden Golems (from Treasure)
  - **This is BRUTAL—almost impossible for level 5-8 party without sacrifices.**

**Partial Sacrifices (2-3 altars activated):**
- Boss gains 2-3 of the refused altar consequences (moderate difficulty increase).
- Example: Refuse Blood and Time = Boss gets regeneration + legendary actions (CR 9-10).

## Crowd Favor Dynamics

### Sacrifices Made (Power at a Price):
- Activate Blood Altar: +2 [[crowds_favor|Favor]] for courage ("They bleed for victory!").
- Activate Memory Altar: +3 Favor for tragedy ("They sacrifice their very identity!").
- Activate Treasure Altar: +1 Favor for humility ("Gold means nothing to champions!").
- Activate Time Altar: +2 Favor for gravitas ("They give YEARS of life!").
- Activate Bond Altar: +4 Favor for ruthlessness ("They sever love itself! COLD! BRUTAL!").

### Sacrifices Refused (Moral Victory):
- Refuse Blood Altar: +1 Favor for resilience ("They keep their lifeblood!").
- Refuse Memory Altar: +1 Favor for identity ("They remember who they ARE!").
- Refuse Treasure Altar: -1 Favor for greed ("They cling to coins!").
- Refuse Time Altar: +1 Favor for youth ("They refuse to age!").
- Refuse Bond Altar: +5 Favor for love ("THEY WILL NOT BETRAY! Friendship UNBROKEN!").

### Combat Outcomes:
- Defeat boss with 0 sacrifices: +10 Favor (legendary moment: "THEY CONQUERED THE UNKILLABLE! No price paid! Pure WILL!").
- Defeat boss with 1-2 sacrifices: +5 Favor (balanced approach).
- Defeat boss with 3-4 sacrifices: +2 Favor (power hungry but effective).
- Defeat boss with all 5 sacrifices: -2 Favor (crowd sees them as soulless monsters: "What are they now? Hollow shells!").

## Moral Dilemmas and Team Conflict

**Who Sacrifices What?**
- Blood Altar: High-HP character (Barbarian, Fighter) logical choice—but they might refuse.
- Memory Altar: Utility character (Wizard with Investigation proficiency) least impactful—but they treasure knowledge.
- Treasure Altar: Who's carrying most gold? Do they donate it willingly or resist?
- Time Altar: Youngest character ages least noticeably—but aging 10 years is horrifying for elf (loses 0.1% of lifespan vs. human losing 10-15%).
- Bond Altar: Who betrays whom? This creates LASTING campaign tension.

**Roleplay Opportunities:**
- Selfish PC refuses to sacrifice: "I'm not bleeding for you!"
- Selfless PC volunteers for multiple altars: "I'll take them all. Don't let this change you."
- Team negotiates: "I'll bleed if you give your gold."
- Crowd watches negotiations—announcer narrates: "They DEBATE! Time ticks! Will greed or courage win?!"

## Announcer Beats

- Opening: "FIVE ALTARS! FIVE PRICES! Pay and gain POWER—or refuse and face the UNKILLABLE!"
- First sacrifice: "BLOOD FLOWS! / MEMORY FADES! / GOLD CONSUMED! / TIME STOLEN! / BONDS SEVERED! The altar accepts!"
- Altar refused: "They REFUSE! Pride or principles? The boss grows STRONGER!"
- Boss spawns (0 sacrifices): "THE UNKILLABLE EXECUTIONER RISES! They face it with NO BOONS! Madness or BRAVERY?!"
- Boss spawns (5 sacrifices): "The Executioner weakens! But what have they BECOME?! Monsters to fight a monster!"
- Mid-combat (boss regenerating): "IT HEALS! They refused the Blood Altar—now they PAY!"
- Victory (0 sacrifices): "IMPOSSIBLE! NO SACRIFICES! PURE SKILL! PURE WILL! LEGENDS!"
- Victory (5 sacrifices): "They win... but at what cost? Gold gone, memories lost, bonds broken. Are they still HUMAN?"
- Defeat: "The price unpaid, the fight unwinnable! They fall before the Executioner!"

## GM Tips

- **Pre-Combat Discussion:** Let players ACTUALLY debate—this is roleplay gold. Set 10-minute real-time timer if needed.
- **Altar Descriptions:** Make each altar viscerally described—blood dripping, fog swirling, gold glinting—tempt and repulse simultaneously.
- **Boon Clarity:** Clearly state what each boon does mechanically before activation—no "gotcha" hidden downsides beyond stated sacrifice.
- **Boss Scaling Transparency:** After boss spawns, describe its power level: "You see pristine armor (high AC), golden minions forming, axes crackling with power (legendary actions)..." Let PCs KNOW their refusals have consequences.
- **Sacrifice Permanence:** Emphasize sacrifices are REAL—Memory loss persists post-combat, aging is visible, bond curse lasts 7 days (NPCs react differently to aged PC, etc.).
- **Emotional Weight:** When Bond Altar activated, roleplay the severing—PC feels sudden coldness toward chosen ally, alien sensation (still allies mechanically, just can't voluntarily help).
- **Crowd Reactions:** Crowd gasps at Blood sacrifice, weeps at Memory loss, jeers at Treasure refusal, mourns at Bond severing.

## Tactical Elements

- **Boon Stacking:** More sacrifices = more boons = easier fight. Mathematical optimization vs. moral cost.
- **Boss Priority Targets:** Unkillable Executioner (with legendary actions) can down PCs fast—without boons, tactics must be PERFECT.
- **Golden Golems:** If summoned (Treasure refused), party must split focus—golems block access to boss.
- **Regeneration Counter:** Boss with regeneration requires radiant damage source (paladin smite, *sacred flame*, etc.)—otherwise, damage race is unwinnable.
- **AC 18 Boss:** Without advantage (Memory Altar boon), hitting AC 18 consistently is very hard—expect many misses.

## Aftermath Seeds

- **Sacrifice Marks:** Each PC who sacrificed bears visible mark:
  - Blood: Pale skin, tired eyes (cosmetic).
  - Memory: Occasional confusion, forgets minor details (roleplay).
  - Treasure: Empty purse, broke (mechanically poor until next payout).
  - Time: Gray hair, wrinkles (cosmetic, NPCs react—"You look older?").
  - Bond: Cold demeanor toward severed ally (7-day curse, then restored but relationship strained).
- **Patron Interest:** Collector fascinated by "those who refused"—offers to buy their story for biography (500 gp, fame boost).
- **Rumor:** Altars were ancient divine tests—gods watching to see if mortals choose power or integrity. PCs' choices noted by celestial/infernal patrons.
- **Downtime:** Restoration services available—*greater restoration* costs 200 gp per casting (Memory, Time reversal). Bond curse requires *remove curse* (100 gp).
- **Injury:** PC who sacrificed HP (Blood Altar) develops chronic fatigue (disadvantage on first Constitution save each day for 1 week, then recovers).
- **Legendary Moment:** If defeated boss with 0 sacrifices, religious orders declare PCs "Virtuous Champions"—temples offer free healing/lodging for 1 month.
- **Political:** Arena's use of corrupting altars angers clerics—protests outside, calls for ban on "soul-selling spectacles." PCs may be asked to testify.
- **Cursed Altar:** One altar (Bond or Memory) remains active post-combat—whispers to PCs during downtime: "Return... sacrifice more... gain more..." (creepy temptation subplot).
- **Loot:** Defeating boss yields **Executioner's Greataxe** (+2 weapon, deals extra 1d12 to creatures who have sacrificed at altars—cursed to tempt wielder toward making own sacrifices).
