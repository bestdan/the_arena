# Night Game

- **Hook:** Arena lights die; magical darkness blankets the sands. The crowd sees everything via arcane scry-screens while combatants stumble blind. The wager: who can cross the killing field in the dark?
- **Party:** 4-6 PCs, level 3+. Emphasize fog-of-war and line-of-sight on VTT (Owlbear.rodeo).

## Arena Layout
- 120-foot-long run from Gate A (start) to Gate B (escape). Narrow alleys of waist-high stone and canvas stalls create a maze. A few waist-high braziers shed only dim light in 10-foot circles (not enough to pierce magical darkness).
- Magical darkness covers the whole floor for combatants; the audience sees normally via illusions projected above the arena.
- Sound booms and echoes; direction checks to locate threats are at disadvantage unless within 10 feet.

## Darkness Rules (table-facing)
- Magical darkness: nonmagical light fails; darkvision fails. A creature with *Devil's Sight* or similar ignores it (these enemies exploit that).
- Reveals: consuming a torch, sunrod, or light source only grants dim 5-foot glow (visibility but imposes "spotlight"—enemies lock on).
- Owlbear.rodeo: enforce limited vision; reveal only explored squares. Allow shouted call-outs; mark last known enemy pings briefly.

## Enemies (stealth hunters)
- 2 Shadow Hounds (reskin Dire Wolves with Devil's Sight, pack tactics in darkness).
- 3 Stalker Acolytes (use Cultist with higher Dex; cast *darkness* once to relocate, have Devil's Sight).
- 1 Umbral Skirmisher (use Gloom Stalker-flavored Scout with advantage while unseen; can bonus-action Hide in dim/dark).
- Flex for 4 PCs: drop 1 Stalker Acolyte and lower Skirmisher to Bandit Captain with stealth focus. Flex for 6 PCs: add 1 more Shadow Hound and give Skirmisher a once-per-fight shadow step (30 feet to dim spot).

## Objectives
- Primary: reach Gate B with at least half the party conscious.
- Secondary: optional control point mid-field (raise lantern mast) grants brief 20-foot bright light for 1 round; earns Crowd Favor and reveals all creatures in radius.

## Crowd Favor Hooks
- First PC to ping an enemy and call its position so another lands a hit: +1 Favor to both.
- Raising the lantern mast under pressure: +2 Favor to the rigger.
- Solo straggler caught and saved by coordinated rescue: +1 Favor to savior, +1 to straggler.
- Dropping an enemy with a Panache-declared strike while blinded: +2 Favor.

## Hazards and Noise
- Loose gravel patches (difficult terrain) crunch loudly; moving through gives away position (no stealth).
- Hanging chimes in two choke points; brushing them pings location to all enemies within 60 feet.
- Canvas stalls can be slashed to create new paths; doing so makes noise and brief light leaks (dim 5 feet).

## Announcer Beats
- Opening: "Welcome to the Night Game—watch from on high as our gladiators grope through the void!"
- Mid-fight twist: lantern mast flickers once, revealing all for a heartbeat; announcer shouts out a close call.
- Finale: spotlight (illusory) highlights the first PC to touch Gate B; crowd chant builds as others scramble.

## GM Tips
- Call for frequent Perception checks to hear padded steps or growls; give rough bearings, not grid positions.
- Track who talks; enemies key on loud voices. Reward clever misdirection (throwing rocks, fake calls).
- Encourage party to stick together or risk isolation; pack tactics punish loners.
- If pacing drags, let the darkness ripple: momentary glimpses (reveal silhouettes for 1 round) to prompt movement.
