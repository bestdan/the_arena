# The Polyglot's Gauntlet

- **Hook:** A linguist's final test—the arena floor is a library of languages. Seven ancient phrases are scattered across the sands, each inscribed in a different tongue. Gather the translations, piece together the master phrase, and recite it at the Tower of Tongues to claim victory. But the arena's guardians speak only in violence, and time waits for no translator.
- **Party:** 4-6 PCs, level 5+. Emphasize language skills, knowledge checks, cross-referencing clues, and gathering under combat pressure.

## Arena Layout
- Hexagonal arena (140 feet across) with **7 Language Stations** positioned around the perimeter (one per side, plus one in center).
- **Tower of Tongues** (30 feet tall, stone tower) at the arena's heart—where the final translated phrase must be spoken.
- Each Language Station contains:
  - A **Phrase Pillar** (10 feet tall stone column with inscriptions in a specific language).
  - A **Translation Codex** (stone tablet or scroll containing vocabulary/grammar hints for that language).
  - Guardian creatures that activate when PCs approach.
- Terrain: stone paths connecting stations (normal terrain), sand pits between paths (difficult terrain), scattered bookshelves and lecterns (cover, can be destroyed).
- Crowd watches with fascination—many are scholars and linguists betting on which language the PCs will master first.

## Core Mechanic: Multilingual Translation Puzzle
The arena contains **7 Phrase Pillars**, each inscribed with one phrase in a different language. Collectively, they form a seven-part incantation that must be translated and recited at the Tower of Tongues.

### The Seven Languages & Phrases
Each Language Station features a different language with a phrase that forms part of the final incantation:

1. **Draconic Station:** *"Kasvriith nakis"* — Translation: "Power awakens"
2. **Elvish Station:** *"Lle naa vanima"* — Translation: "You are beautiful" (misdirection—should be: "Magic flows")
3. **Dwarvish Station:** *"Khazad ai-mênu"* — Translation: "Dwarves upon you" (actually means: "Stone endures")
4. **Infernal Station:** *"Infernus dominus"* — Translation: "Infernal lord" (correct: "Fire consumes")
5. **Celestial Station:** *"Caelum benedictus"* — Translation: "Heaven blessed" (correct: "Light protects")
6. **Abyssal Station:** *"Tharask nar'zuul"* — Translation: "Darkness eternal"
7. **Primordial Station:** *"Kresh-ala thuun"* — Translation: "Elements unite"

### Translation Codices
Each station's **Translation Codex** contains:
- A small dictionary (10-15 key words in that language with Common translations).
- Grammar hints (sentence structure, common phrases).
- **Deliberate errors or misdirections** in 2-3 codices (Elvish, Dwarvish, Infernal contain misleading translations; Insight DC 15 or proficiency in the language reveals the truth).

### Gathering & Translation Process
1. **Visit Station:** PC must reach a Language Station (navigate arena, avoid/fight guardians).
2. **Study Phrase Pillar:** Spend **1 action** to read the phrase aloud (in original language) and memorize or transcribe it.
3. **Consult Codex:** Spend **1 action** to study the Translation Codex and attempt translation:
   - If PC has proficiency in the language: automatic success, no roll needed.
   - If PC uses the Codex without proficiency: Intelligence check DC 13 (DC 16 if codex contains errors).
   - Success reveals translation (DM provides the translated phrase).
   - Failure means mistranslation (incorrect translation that may lead to wrong final incantation).
4. **Detect Errors (Optional):** PC can spend **1 action** to make Insight DC 15 check to detect if a codex contains deliberate errors.

### Master Incantation
Once all seven phrases are gathered and translated, PCs must assemble them in the **correct order** (determined by clues hidden in the Tower of Tongues base—see below) and **recite the full incantation** at the tower.

**Correct Order:** Power awakens → Magic flows → Stone endures → Fire consumes → Light protects → Darkness eternal → Elements unite

**Tower of Tongues Sequence Clue:**
- The tower base has seven slots arranged in a circle, each marked with a **symbol** (dragon, leaf, mountain, flame, sun, void, wave).
- PCs must match the symbols to the languages: dragon = Draconic, leaf = Elvish, mountain = Dwarvish, flame = Infernal, sun = Celestial, void = Abyssal, wave = Primordial.
- Symbols are ordered clockwise starting from the north slot (Intelligence [Investigation] DC 12 to deduce pattern, or trial-and-error).

### Reciting the Incantation
- One PC must stand at the Tower of Tongues and **recite all seven translated phrases in the correct order** (takes 1 full round, requires concentration).
- **Correct Incantation:** Tower glows, arena gates open, guardians deactivate—victory!
- **Incorrect Incantation:** Tower releases shockwave (4d8 thunder damage in 30-foot radius, Dex save DC 15 for half); all guardians enrage (+2 to hit, +1d6 damage for 3 rounds); attempt can be retried.
- **Mistranslations:** If PCs used wrong translations (due to errors in codices or failed checks), the incantation fails (same effect as incorrect incantation).

### Time Pressure
- **Round 12:** Arena begins **linguistic corruption**—inscriptions on Phrase Pillars start fading (PCs who haven't visited a station yet must make Intelligence check DC 16 to read the fading text).
- **Round 15:** Arena floor starts collapsing (see Hazards); creates urgency to complete puzzle.

## Enemies (Linguistic Guardians)
Each Language Station is guarded by creatures thematically linked to that language's origin. Guardians **activate when PCs approach within 15 feet** of their station.

### 4 PCs
- **Draconic Station:** 1 **Wyrmling Guard** (use Guard Drake, CR 2; breathes fire).
- **Elvish Station:** 2 **Fey Sentinels** (use Sprite, CR 1/4; invisible, use bows).
- **Dwarvish Station:** 1 **Stone Warden** (use Gargoyle, CR 2; stone skin).
- **Infernal Station:** 2 **Imp Scholars** (use Imp, CR 1; invisibility, sting attacks).
- **Celestial Station:** 1 **Radiant Guardian** (use Deva, CR 10, reduced HP to 80; holy protector).
- **Abyssal Station:** 2 **Shadow Scribes** (use Shadow, CR 1/2; drain strength).
- **Primordial Station:** 1 **Elemental Herald** (use Air Elemental, CR 5, reduced HP to 60; whirlwind attacks).

### 5 PCs
- Add 1 more creature to each station (e.g., 2 Wyrmlings, 3 Sprites, 2 Gargoyles, etc.).
- **Radiant Guardian** HP increased to 100.
- **Elemental Herald** HP increased to 70.

### 6 PCs
- Add 1 more creature to each station again.
- **Radiant Guardian** HP increased to 120.
- **Elemental Herald** HP increased to 80.
- Add 1 **Wandering Polyglot** (use Archmage, CR 12, reduced HP to 60; roams arena; casts *dispel magic* on PCs carrying translated phrases, forcing them to retranslate).

### Enemy Tactics
- **Wyrmling Guard** uses breath weapon to threaten PCs studying the Draconic codex.
- **Fey Sentinels** remain invisible until PCs touch the Elvish codex, then attack from range.
- **Stone Warden** stands motionless until touched, then grapples PCs to prevent them from leaving with translations.
- **Imp Scholars** use invisibility to steal codices temporarily (must be defeated or driven away to recover).
- **Radiant Guardian** uses healing magic to restore fallen guardians at other stations (priority target).
- **Shadow Scribes** drain Strength from PCs carrying heavy codices or scrolls.
- **Elemental Herald** uses whirlwind to scatter papers and codices (PCs must gather them again).
- **Wandering Polyglot** (if present) actively hunts PCs who have translated phrases; uses *counterspell* and *dispel magic* to erase progress.

## Objectives
- **Primary:** Gather all seven phrases from the Language Stations and translate them correctly.
- **Secondary:** Deduce the correct order of the translated phrases and recite the full incantation at the Tower of Tongues.
- **Tertiary:** Complete the puzzle before Round 15 (collapsing arena).
- **Bonus:** Identify and correct all mistranslations from error-filled codices (bonus Favor).

## Tactical Elements
- **Station Specialization:** PCs with language proficiencies should prioritize matching stations (automatic translation success).
- **Codex Study:** Taking time to consult codices (1 action) vs. fighting guardians—must balance puzzle-solving with combat.
- **Error Detection:** PCs must decide whether to trust codices or spend extra time verifying translations (Insight checks).
- **Translation Relay:** PCs can split up to gather phrases faster, then regroup to share translations and assemble the final incantation.
- **Guardian Prioritization:** Radiant Guardian can revive fallen guardians—should be eliminated first if possible.
- **Resource Management:** Spells like *comprehend languages*, *tongues*, or *identify* can bypass some translation challenges.

## Hazards and Twists
- **Fading Inscriptions (Round 12+):** Phrase Pillars' text begins fading; PCs who haven't visited stations yet must make Intelligence DC 16 checks to read text before it vanishes.
- **Collapsing Arena (Round 15+):** Floor crumbles at edges; 1d4 random 10x10 sections collapse per round (Dex save DC 15 or fall 20 feet; 2d6 bludgeoning damage).
- **Misleading Codices:** Elvish, Dwarvish, and Infernal codices contain deliberate errors (Insight DC 15 to detect; wrong translations lead to failed incantation).
- **Stolen Codices:** Imp Scholars can steal codices temporarily (fly away; must be defeated or chased down within 3 rounds or codex is destroyed).
- **Guardian Revival:** Radiant Guardian can use action to cast *revivify* on destroyed guardians at other stations (resets station to full strength).
- **Linguistic Corruption:** If PCs spend more than 3 rounds at a single station, the language **mutates**—inscriptions change to a hybrid language requiring new translation (increases DC by +3).
- **Round 10 Twist:** Wandering Polyglot (if present) appears and begins hunting PCs with translations; shouts challenges in multiple languages.

## Crowd Favor Hooks
- First PC to successfully translate a phrase using a codex: +1 [[crowds_favor|Favor]].
- Translate a phrase using innate language proficiency (no codex needed): +2 Favor for linguistic mastery.
- Detect and correct a mistranslation from an error-filled codex: +2 Favor for attention to detail.
- Defeat a guardian while simultaneously studying a codex (multitasking): +2 Favor.
- Recover a stolen codex from an Imp Scholar within 2 rounds: +1 Favor.
- Deduce the correct order of the incantation on first attempt (no trial-and-error at Tower): +3 Favor.
- Recite the full incantation correctly without errors: +4 Favor for linguistic perfection.
- Complete puzzle before Round 12 (before inscriptions fade): +2 Favor for speed.
- Use [[panache|Panache]] to dramatically recite a translated phrase: +1 Favor.

## Announcer Beats
- Opening: "Seven tongues! Seven secrets! Scattered words hold the key to FREEDOM! **Can they master language itself?!**"
- First phrase discovered: "The Draconic pillar speaks! One tongue down—six remain! But can they TRANSLATE IT?!"
- First translation completed: "SUCCESS! They decode the first phrase! Ancient words yield to mortal minds!"
- Mistranslation detected: "WAIT! That translation is WRONG! Will they catch the deception before it's too late?!"
- Guardian revival: "The Celestial Guardian restores the fallen! NO REST for our scholars!"
- Imp steals codex: "The imp TAKES their tools! Chase it down or LOSE the knowledge!"
- Round 12 (fading inscriptions): "The words FADE! The arena turns against them! Read NOW or NEVER!"
- Incorrect incantation attempted: "WRONG! Thunder ROARS! The tower REJECTS them! Try again, linguists!"
- Correct incantation recited: "THE TOWER GLOWS! Seven tongues become ONE! Language conquered! **Tarsus roars for the POLYGLOTS!**"

## GM Tips
- **Pre-Prep Phrases:** Write out all seven phrases in their original languages and translations. Create codex handouts with 10-15 vocabulary words per language.
- **Plant Errors:** In Elvish, Dwarvish, and Infernal codices, include 2-3 wrong translations. Make them plausible but incorrect (e.g., "vanima" = beautiful, but in context should mean "flowing").
- **Language Proficiencies:** Ask players before session which languages their PCs know. Assign stations strategically so at least some PCs can auto-translate.
- **Codex Handouts:** Give players physical codices (printed vocabulary lists) to simulate the in-game study process. Let them cross-reference words.
- **Translation Time:** Don't rush; give players 1-2 minutes per station to consult codices and attempt translations. Make it feel like detective work.
- **Symbol Matching:** Tower base has seven symbols (dragon, leaf, mountain, flame, sun, void, wave); make it a visual puzzle. Use miniatures or draw on map.
- **Guardian Activation:** Describe guardians as dormant statues/spirits that "awaken" when PCs approach (creates suspense).
- **Radiant Guardian Priority:** Make it clear the Celestial Guardian can revive others; encourage PCs to prioritize it.
- **Imp Shenanigans:** Imps stealing codices should be annoying but recoverable (fly 30 feet away; PCs can chase, shoot, or grab with spells).
- **Wandering Polyglot Drama:** If present, have Polyglot taunt PCs in multiple languages ("Pitiful! You call THAT Draconic?!"); creates personality and stakes.
- **Incantation Ritual:** When PC recites incantation, make it dramatic—describe each phrase resonating, tower glowing brighter, symbols lighting up in sequence.

## Aftermath Seeds
- **Patron Interest:** Linguistic guild offers contract to translate ancient texts, decode enemy communications, or teach rare languages.
- **Rumor:** The master incantation was actually a **summoning spell**—somewhere in the world, an ancient entity has been awakened by the recitation (side quest hook).
- **Downtime:** PC who translated the most phrases gains **Polyglot's Gift** (advantage on Intelligence checks involving languages for 1 week; can attempt to read any language with DC 15 check).
- **Injury:** PC who suffered tower shockwave (incorrect incantation) develops **Linguistic Trauma** (disadvantage on Charisma checks for 1d4 days; words come out garbled; removable via *lesser restoration*).
- **Political:** Scholars in crowd debate which translation was most elegant; patron sponsorships shift based on PCs' demonstrated linguistic prowess.
- **Loot:** Translation Codices (if retrieved) function as **Linguistic Tomes** (study for 1 hour to gain proficiency in one language for 24 hours; single use; 150 gp value each).
- **Secret:** One of the Phrase Pillars contains a **hidden inscription** visible only with *detect magic* or Primordial proficiency—reveals location of ancient library beneath the arena.
- **NPC Contact:** The Wandering Polyglot (if present and survived) offers to become a recurring NPC contact—sells translation services, decodes enemy plans, or provides intel on foreign powers.
