# The Crumbling Bridge

## Hook
The arena has been transformed into a massive stone bridge over a pit of spike-mawed creatures. The bridge is crumbling section by section from both ends. The gladiators must escort a fragile NPC across while fighting enemies AND the collapsing terrain—with no room to retreat.

## The Bridge
- 120 ft long, 15 ft wide stone bridge
- Divided into 12 sections (10 ft each)
- Party starts on one end (section 1), must reach the other end (section 12)
- **The Sculptor** (NPC) starts in middle (section 6)

### Collapse Mechanic
- End of round 1: Sections 1 and 12 crack (warning)
- End of round 2: Sections 1 and 12 collapse
- End of round 3: Sections 2 and 11 crack
- Pattern continues (collapse 1 round after cracking)
- By round 10, only sections 5-8 remain

### Falling
- Falling into the pit = 2d6 fall damage + 2d6 piercing from spike creatures
- DC 14 Dex save to grab edge if you're on a collapsing section
- Climbing back up = action + DC 12 Athletics

## The Sculptor (NPC)
- Elderly artisan who created the arena's famous statues
- **HP**: 12 | **AC**: 10 | **Speed**: 20 ft (frail, slow)
- Will not move unless a PC is adjacent (too scared)
- Can be carried (counts as encumbered—speed -10 ft for carrier)
- If Sculptor dies, the match is a LOSS regardless of survival

### Sculptor's Value
- If saved: Creates a statue of the party (permanent arena decoration, +5 reputation)
- Knows secrets about the arena's construction (future plot hooks)
- Can craft one custom item during downtime

## Enemies
- **2 Bridge Lurkers** (Gargoyle stats, CR 2)—fly, swoop in from sides, try to knock PCs off
- **4 Pit Crawlers** (Giant Spider stats, CR 1)—climb up from pit, web PCs to slow them
- Pit Crawlers prioritize the Sculptor (easy target)

### Enemy Tactics
- Lurkers attack middle of the party to create separation
- Pit Crawlers web PCs near edges, then push (Shove action)
- If bridge narrows (late rounds), enemies bottleneck the exit

## Crowd's Favor Opportunities
- Save the Sculptor from a Pit Crawler: +2 Favor
- Jump across a collapsing section: Panache roll
- Carry the Sculptor across dangerous terrain: +1 Favor
- Knock an enemy off the bridge: +1 Favor (crowd loves falls)
- Last PC off a section before it collapses: Panache roll + 1 Favor (dramatic escape)

## Scaling
- **3 PCs**: 1 Lurker, 2 Pit Crawlers, collapse every 3 rounds instead of 2
- **5 PCs**: 3 Lurkers, 6 Pit Crawlers, bridge is 20 ft wide

## Environmental Hazards
- **Loose Stones**: Sections 4 and 9 are unstable—DC 12 Dex or fall prone when entering
- **Narrow Point**: Section 7 is only 5 ft wide (single file)—bottleneck
- **Cracked Sections**: Standing on a cracked section when it collapses = automatic fall (no save)
- **Pit Creatures**: If PC falls but survives, 1d4 **Crawling Claws** (CR 0) attack them in the pit

## Announcer Beats
- "The BRIDGE crumbles! Our gladiators must RUN, FIGHT, and RESCUE!"
- Section collapses: "GONE! Section [X] falls into the ABYSS! Keep MOVING!"
- Sculptor wobbles: "The SCULPTOR! Fragile as his own clay! PROTECT HIM!"
- PC falls: "INTO THE PIT! Can they climb back before the SPIKES claim them?"
- Dramatic jump: "AIRBORNE! Between death and death, they LEAP!"

## GM Tips
- Use a physical countdown or remove sections from the map as they fall
- The Sculptor should be annoying but endearing—"In my day, bridges stayed PUT!"
- If party leaves Sculptor too far behind, have a Pit Crawler grab him (urgent rescue)
- Narrow point at section 7 is the tension peak—make it dramatic

## The Sculptor (Personality)
- **Name**: Mikos the Elder
- **Voice**: Trembling, prone to tangents about his art
- **Motivation**: Wants to create one final masterpiece before death
- If carried: "Dignity! I still have—well, had—dignity!"
- If saved: "You! You will be my LEGACY piece!"

## Aftermath Seeds
- Sculptor creates party statue—becomes landmark, +1 Favor to ALL future matches
- Lurker wings can be harvested—crafting component for cloak of gliding
- Pit Crawlers' webbing is valuable (25 gp per intact body)—but requires going INTO the pit
- Sculptor knows about a hidden room in the arena (future exploration opportunity)
