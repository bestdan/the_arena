# The Color War

## Hook
The arena has been divided into red and blue zones. The gladiators fight to "claim" territory by defeating enemies on a tile or completing objectives. The team controlling more territory when the horn sounds wins—but the territories fight back.

## Territory Mechanics

### Claiming Tiles
- Arena is divided into 20 zones (5 ft hexes or 10 ft squares, your preference)
- Zones start neutral (grey)
- **PC Claims**: Defeat an enemy on a zone OR spend action + DC 10 Charisma to "plant flag"
- **Enemy Claims**: Enemy stands on zone for 2 consecutive rounds OR defeats PC on zone
- Claimed zones glow team color (red for enemies, blue for PCs)

### Territory Effects
- **Blue Zones** (PC-controlled): PCs have +1 AC while on them, enemies have -1 AC
- **Red Zones** (enemy-controlled): Enemies have +1 to attacks, PCs have -1
- **Contested** (adjacent to both colors): Difficult terrain, sparking energy

### Victory Condition
After 10 rounds, horn sounds. Team with more zones wins:
- **PC Victory**: Bonus loot, +3 Crowd's Favor, patron impressed
- **Enemy Victory**: PCs survive but humiliated, -2 Crowd's Favor, must fight sudden death round
- **Tie**: Both teams fight in shrinking arena (outer zones collapse each round)

## Arena Layout
- 20 claimable zones in arena center
- **4 Control Points** (marked with banners)—worth 2 zones each, require 2 actions to claim
- **High Ground** (center)—worth 1 zone but provides +2 to ranged attacks
- **Walls** (between zones)—some zones separated by low walls (half cover)

## Enemies
- **1 Red Team Captain** (Veteran stats, CR 3)—strategist, directs minions to spread out
- **4 Red Team Grunts** (Guard stats, CR 1/8)—spread to claim as many zones as possible
- **1 Red Banner Bearer** (Bandit Captain stats, CR 2)—wherever they stand counts as claimed (mobile claim)

### Enemy Strategy
- Grunts spread wide early, claiming corners
- Captain defends central control point
- Banner Bearer roams, converting zones just by walking through

## Crowd's Favor Opportunities
- Claim a control point: +1 Favor (dramatic flag plant)
- Hold the high ground for 3 consecutive rounds: +2 Favor
- Reclaim a red zone in dramatic fashion: Panache roll
- Defeat enemy on contested zone: +1 Favor
- Win the color war (majority control): +3 Favor

## Scaling
- **3 PCs**: 3 Grunts, no Banner Bearer, 15 zones total
- **5 PCs**: 5 Grunts, add 1 extra Captain, 25 zones total

## Environmental Hazards
- **Color Bombs**: 4 bombs scattered (action to throw, 15 ft range)—explode in 10 ft radius, claim all affected zones for thrower's team
- **Neutral Turret**: Center turret attacks whichever team controls FEWER zones (balancing force), 1d8 damage
- **Zone Collapse**: Every 3 rounds after round 6, one random neutral zone crumbles (falls into pit)

## Announcer Beats
- "Welcome to the COLOR WAR! Paint the arena with VICTORY!"
- Zone claimed: "BLUE takes the northwest! The tide TURNS!"
- Control point captured: "The control point is THEIRS! That's worth DOUBLE!"
- Banner Bearer moving: "The RED BANNER advances! Every step is a CLAIM!"
- Sudden death: "A TIE? Unacceptable! SUDDEN DEATH! The arena SHRINKS!"

## GM Tips
- Track zones on paper or use colored tokens on map
- Enemies should spread out—this is about territory, not killing
- Let the Banner Bearer feel like a threat (mobile claim is powerful)
- If one side dominates early, have the Neutral Turret even things out

## The Red Captain (Personality)
- Professional gladiator team, not monsters
- Respects good tactics, openly compliments clever plays
- If defeated honorably, offers handshake (crowd loves sportsmanship: +1 Favor)
- If defeated dishonorably (attacked while down, etc.), swears revenge

## Aftermath Seeds
- Color Bombs can be salvaged (1-2 remain)—useful for future tactical situations
- Red Team Captain, if spared, may become ally in future team matches
- Victory in Color War = invitation to "championship" team combat event (future session)
- Banner (if captured) can be displayed in camp—morale boost, +1 to downtime recovery
