# Condemned Sacrifice

- **Party:** 5 Level 2 PCs with possible NPC allies.
- **Theme:** Moral choice and asymmetric combat against desperate prisoners before a brutal encore.

## Setup
PCs face condemned prisoners promised freedom if they win. Many are non-warriors: desperate, protective, and fearful. A guard overseer drives them forward from the edge.

## Enemies
- 8-10 Prisoners (Commoner statblock with clubs/improvised weapons).
- 2 Prisoner Leaders (Bandits, CR 1/8).
- 1 Guard overseer with whip directing from the perimeter.

## Twist
- Some prisoners surrender if offered mercy; others fight to shield family.
- Crowd reaction hinges on how PCs handle mercy vs brutality.
- Rohm and the steppes youth are watching; stakes feel personal.

## Crowd Mechanics
- Brutal efficiency: Favor from bloodthirsty nobles.
- Mercy/sparing lives: Favor from common folk.
- Creative non-lethal solutions: Favor from theatrical patrons.
- Taking too long/appearing weak: lose Favor.

## Second Act
After prisoners resolved, the real fight lands:
- 1 Gladiator Champion (Veteran, CR 3) descends fresh while PCs are worn.
- This tests endurance and consequences of earlier choices.

## Drama Hooks
- One prisoner ties to a PC's backstory.
- Snak notes who chose mercy vs cruelty.
- A powerful Senator watches; opinion shapes future patronage.
- Survivors could recur as NPCs.
