# Archmage Ascendant

- **Hook:** A visiting archmage wagers their tower's fortune—survive their "Spellweave Showcase" and the gladiators earn a patron beyond compare. The crowd watches raw magical might bend reality on the sands.
- **Party:** 4-6 PCs, level 9-11. High-stakes endgame. Expect tactical spell counters and environmental manipulation.

## Arena Layout
- Central ritual circle (30-foot diameter) crackling with ley energy; standing inside grants arcane conductivity (+1d4 to spell attacks but vulnerability to lightning/force).
- Four floating spell-stones orbit the edges (60-foot zone); destroying a stone (AC 15, 30 HP, immune to psychic) cuts the archmage's spell slot recovery.
- Prismatic walls rise and fall along cardinal directions (initiative count 20 and 10)—touching deals 6d6 damage (random type) and blocks movement for 1 round.
- Scrying orbs hover above; crowd sees every spell component gesture magnified.

## Enemies (solo archmage plus constructs)
- 1 **Archmage** (CR 12)—modified with Contingency (*dimension door* when hit below half HP) and Glyph of Warding traps near spell-stones.
- 2 **Shield Guardians** (CR 7) bound to archmage; amulets worn openly as challenge ("destroy my shields if you dare").
- 4 **Animated Spell Tomes** (reskin Flying Swords with 15 HP each)—cast *magic missile* (3 darts, +1d4+1 each) as attack action; swarm and distract.
- **Flex:** For 4 PCs, remove 1 Shield Guardian and 2 Spell Tomes; archmage starts with one 7th-level slot expended. For 6 PCs, add 1 **Invisible Stalker** as archmage's hidden trump card (reveals when bloodied).

## Spell Showcase Phases
- **Phase 1 (Opening):** Archmage casts *wall of force* to split party, then pelts with *cone of cold* and *lightning bolt*. Shield Guardians advance to pin melee fighters.
- **Phase 2 (Bloodied, ~60 HP):** Archmage uses *time stop* if available, repositioning and laying *cloudkill* or *wall of fire*. Contingency may trigger *dimension door* to opposite spell-stone.
- **Phase 3 (Critical, ~30 HP):** Desperation—*meteor swarm* if outdoors or *delayed blast fireball* set to detonate in 2 rounds. Spell Tomes kamikaze into nearest PCs.

## Crowd Favor Hooks
- Counterspelling the archmage's signature spell (*meteor swarm*, *time stop*, or *cone of cold*): +3 Favor to caster.
- Destroying a spell-stone mid-combat while engaged with enemy: +2 Favor.
- Surviving a prismatic wall touch and staying conscious: +1 Favor.
- Landing killing blow on archmage with a melee weapon (not spell): +3 Favor for "besting magic with steel."
- Using [[panaches]] on an acrobatic dodge through *wall of force* gap: +2 Favor on success.

## Hazards and Interactions
- Ritual circle pulses every 3 rounds (initiative 15): all creatures inside make DC 15 Con save or take 3d8 force damage; archmage immune.
- Spell-stones can be used as cover (three-quarters) but archmage can detonate them remotely (30-foot radius, 6d6 force, Dex DC 16 half).
- Prismatic walls: color sequence rotates (red = fire, orange = acid, yellow = lightning, etc.). PCs with *detect magic* or Arcana check (DC 18) can predict next color.

## Announcer Beats
- Opening: "Behold the Archmage of the Azure Spire—your swords versus spells that sundered cities!"
- Mid-fight: "The gladiators press through prismatic flame—will raw courage triumph over cosmic might?"
- *Time stop* moment: "And now... silence. The archmage moves between seconds—what will our champions face when time resumes?!"
- Finale: "Magic bows to mortality!" (if PCs win) or "The arcane reigns supreme—these fools never stood a chance!" (if TPK looms).

## GM Tips
- Telegraph high-damage spells with verbal components or glowing gestures; give PCs a chance to scatter or ready counterspells.
- Let archmage negotiate mid-fight if bloodied and Shield Guardians down ("Yield—I'll sponsor you!" or "Prove you can counterspell THIS.").
- Encourage casters to burn high slots; martials should focus spell-stones to limit archmage recovery.
- If archmage survives, they become recurring patron or rival; if PCs win brutally, their tower's wealth flows to victors.
- Use [[last_stand]] opportunities—archmage's final *meteor swarm* is perfect setup for heroic sacrifice.

## Aftermath Seeds
- Victor: Archmage's apprentice approaches with sponsorship offer—political intrigue in Tarsus noble circles.
- Loser: PCs respawn via archmage's *clone* spell (kept in tower); now indebted and must serve arcane errands.
- Crowd aftermath: Mages across Tarsus take note—future encounters against spell-slingers come with reputation ("the Archmage-Slayers").
- Loot: Archmage's spellbook (partial), damaged Wand of Lightning Bolts (3 charges left), or Shield Guardian amulet (one construct freed, pledges to party).
