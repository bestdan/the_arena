# Tight Collaboration Session Ideas Index

This index catalogues session ideas that require **mandatory tight cooperation** between players, inspired by the cooperative video game "It Takes Two." Each session features mechanics that force at least two players to work together closely to overcome challenges, while remaining playable for 4-6 players.

## Core Collaboration Mechanics

### Paired Dependency
Sessions where PCs are paired and must coordinate actions:

- **[[linked_fate]]** (Levels 4-7) - Arcane chains bind pairs with shared HP pools and synchronized attack bonuses. Pairs must stay within range and coordinate strikes.
- **[[eyes_and_hands]]** (Levels 4-7) - Half the party is blinded, half has arms bound. Sight guides strength through deadly maze.

### Resource Sharing
Sessions where the entire party shares critical resources:

- **[[shared_spark]]** (Levels 6-9) - Entire party shares single HP pool and spell slot pool. Ultimate resource management test.
- **[[burden_relay]]** (Levels 5-8) - Rotating pairs carry impossible weight while others defend. Timed swaps under fire.

### Asymmetric Abilities
Sessions where different PCs gain different capabilities requiring cooperation:

- **[[giants_and_mice]]** (Levels 6-9) - Half grow to giant size, half shrink to mouse size. Each size solves different problems.
- **[[mirror_worlds]]** (Levels 5-8) - Party split across parallel dimensions. Cross-dimensional coordination required.

## By Difficulty

### Hard (Challenging but Survivable)
- **[[linked_fate]]** (Levels 4-7) - Paired combat with shared HP
- **[[eyes_and_hands]]** (Levels 4-7) - Sensory deprivation cooperation
- **[[giants_and_mice]]** (Levels 6-9) - Size asymmetry puzzles

### Deadly (Brutal Without Perfect Teamwork)
- **[[mirror_worlds]]** (Levels 5-8) - Dimensional split coordination
- **[[burden_relay]]** (Levels 5-8) - Timed rotation under assault
- **[[shared_spark]]** (Levels 6-9) - Shared resource management

## Recommended Progression

For groups new to tight collaboration mechanics:

1. **[[linked_fate]]** - Introduces paired mechanics with clear benefits
2. **[[eyes_and_hands]]** - Builds trust through sensory limitations
3. **[[giants_and_mice]]** - Adds asymmetry and creative problem-solving
4. **[[burden_relay]]** - Introduces timed rotations and role-swapping
5. **[[mirror_worlds]]** - Advanced coordination across barriers
6. **[[shared_spark]]** - Ultimate team-wide resource management

## Design Notes

All collaboration sessions include:
- Mandatory cooperation mechanics (cannot be bypassed solo)
- Scalable enemy rosters for 4-6 players
- [[crowds_favor|Crowd's Favor]] hooks rewarding teamwork
- [[panache|Panache]] opportunities for dramatic cooperation
- GM tips for facilitating communication
- Aftermath seeds for patron interest and character development

**Voice Communication Recommended:** These sessions are designed to simulate "same-room co-op" experiences. Encourage constant verbal coordination!
