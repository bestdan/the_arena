# Tight Collaboration Session Ideas Index

This index catalogues session ideas that require **mandatory tight cooperation** between players, inspired by the cooperative video game "It Takes Two." Each session features mechanics that force at least two players to work together closely to overcome challenges, while remaining playable for 4-6 players.

## Core Collaboration Mechanics

### Paired Dependency
Sessions where PCs are paired and must coordinate actions:

- **[[linked_fate]]** (Levels 4-7) - Arcane chains bind pairs with shared HP pools and synchronized attack bonuses. Pairs must stay within range and coordinate strikes.
- **[[eyes_and_hands]]** (Levels 4-7) - Half the party is blinded, half has arms bound. Sight guides strength through deadly maze.

### Resource Sharing
Sessions where the entire party shares critical resources:

- **[[shared_spark]]** (Levels 6-9) - Entire party shares single HP pool and spell slot pool. Ultimate resource management test.
- **[[burden_relay]]** (Levels 5-8) - Rotating pairs carry impossible weight while others defend. Timed swaps under fire.

### Asymmetric Abilities
Sessions where different PCs gain different capabilities requiring cooperation:

- **[[giants_and_mice]]** (Levels 6-9) - Half grow to giant size, half shrink to mouse size. Each size solves different problems.
- **[[mirror_worlds]]** (Levels 5-8) - Party split across parallel dimensions. Cross-dimensional coordination required.
- **[[the_ascending_abyss]]** (Levels 5-7) - Half have climbing gear, half don't. Vertical combat with rising water requires hauling teammates.
- **[[the_crown_of_tyrants]]** (Levels 5-8) - Corrupting crown must rotate between PCs every 3 rounds. Power shared, curse managed together.

### Communication and Trust
Sessions where coordination through communication is essential:

- **[[the_blind_orchestra]]** (Levels 4-7) - All PCs blinded, must coordinate through sound to play musical puzzle while fighting.
- **[[the_living_labyrinth]]** (Levels 5-7) - Shifting maze with riddle clues. Memory and verbal coordination essential.
- **[[the_memory_crucible]]** (Levels 4-7) - Team must share memory of expanding symbol patterns to damage enemies.
- **[[the_assassins_masquerade]]** (Levels 5-8) - Imposters mimic PCs. Trust verification through questions, codes, and behavior.

### Sacrifice and Choice
Sessions where team must make collective decisions with consequences:

- **[[the_sacrifice_altar]]** (Levels 5-8) - Five altars demand sacrifices (HP, skills, gold, aging, friendship). Team decides who pays what price.

## By Difficulty

### Hard (Challenging but Survivable)
- **[[linked_fate]]** (Levels 4-7) - Paired combat with shared HP
- **[[eyes_and_hands]]** (Levels 4-7) - Sensory deprivation cooperation
- **[[giants_and_mice]]** (Levels 6-9) - Size asymmetry puzzles
- **[[the_blind_orchestra]]** (Levels 4-7) - Darkness + musical puzzle + echolocation combat
- **[[the_ascending_abyss]]** (Levels 5-7) - Vertical climbing with rising water pressure
- **[[the_memory_crucible]]** (Levels 4-7) - Pattern memory under combat pressure

### Deadly (Brutal Without Perfect Teamwork)
- **[[mirror_worlds]]** (Levels 5-8) - Dimensional split coordination
- **[[burden_relay]]** (Levels 5-8) - Timed rotation under assault
- **[[shared_spark]]** (Levels 6-9) - Shared resource management
- **[[the_living_labyrinth]]** (Levels 5-7) - Maze with crushing walls and riddles
- **[[the_crown_of_tyrants]]** (Levels 5-8) - Corruption management with rotation timing
- **[[the_assassins_masquerade]]** (Levels 5-8) - Social deduction under attack
- **[[the_sacrifice_altar]]** (Levels 5-8) - Moral choices scale boss difficulty

## Recommended Progression

For groups new to tight collaboration mechanics:

1. **[[the_memory_crucible]]** - Simple cooperation: share pattern memory, coordinate attacks
2. **[[linked_fate]]** - Introduces paired mechanics with clear benefits
3. **[[the_blind_orchestra]]** - Sensory deprivation + puzzle solving requires constant communication
4. **[[eyes_and_hands]]** - Builds trust through sensory limitations and guidance
5. **[[the_ascending_abyss]]** - Asymmetric resources require helping each other climb
6. **[[giants_and_mice]]** - Adds asymmetry and creative problem-solving
7. **[[the_living_labyrinth]]** - Memory + positioning + riddles under pressure
8. **[[the_crown_of_tyrants]]** - Timed rotations with corruption management
9. **[[burden_relay]]** - Introduces timed rotations and role-swapping
10. **[[the_assassins_masquerade]]** - Trust verification and paranoia management
11. **[[mirror_worlds]]** - Advanced coordination across barriers
12. **[[the_sacrifice_altar]]** - Moral team decisions with permanent consequences
13. **[[shared_spark]]** - Ultimate team-wide resource management

## Design Notes

All collaboration sessions include:
- Mandatory cooperation mechanics (cannot be bypassed solo)
- Scalable enemy rosters for 4-6 players
- [[crowds_favor|Crowd's Favor]] hooks rewarding teamwork
- [[panache|Panache]] opportunities for dramatic cooperation
- GM tips for facilitating communication
- Aftermath seeds for patron interest and character development

**Voice Communication Recommended:** These sessions are designed to simulate "same-room co-op" experiences. Encourage constant verbal coordination!
