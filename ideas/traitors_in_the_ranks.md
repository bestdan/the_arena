# Traitors in the Ranks

- **Party:** 5 Level 2 PCs with allied gladiators who might turn.
- **Theme:** Trust, betrayal, social tension amid brutal melee.

## Setup
The party teams with 3-4 NPC gladiators against a rival crew. Mid-fight, some allies reveal they've been bribed and turn on the PCs.

## Initial Enemy Team
- 5 Enemy Gladiators (mix of Guard and Thug statblocks).
- 1 Enemy Champion (Veteran, CR 3) injured; starts at half HP.

## NPC "Allies"
- 3-4 gladiators fight beside PCs; 2 will betray mid-fight (after round 3 or when Champion <25% HP).
- 1-2 stay loyal; one could be Rohm or another established NPC.

## Combat Flow
- Rounds 1-3: Standard team battle.
- Round 3-4: Betrayal trigger; announcer reveals twist; traitors flip.
- Rounds 4+: Chaos; some enemies might attack traitors; crowd roars.

## Crowd Mechanics
- Peak drama; crowd leans in.
- Survive betrayal: +2 Favor.
- Kill a traitor with Panache: +1 Favor.
- Protect a loyal NPC from a traitor: +1 Favor.
- Foreshadow/turn betrayal to advantage: +3 Favor.

## Drama Hooks
- One traitor is reluctant—can be persuaded back (Persuasion DC 15).
- Enemy Champion respects "honor" and may aid PCs vs traitors.
- Patron declares: "Those who survive this with grace win my support."
- A loyal NPC might die shielding a PC, creating weight for later sessions.
