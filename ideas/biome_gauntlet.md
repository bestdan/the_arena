# Biome Gauntlet

- **Hook:** "NATURE'S FURY UNLEASHED!" The arena cycles through five extreme natural biomes every 2 rounds—desert heat to arctic cold to jungle density to volcanic danger to swamp decay. Each biome hosts predators perfectly adapted to that environment who hunt the gladiators mercilessly. The crowd watches through climate-controlled viewing boxes as fighters struggle to survive Earth's harshest landscapes compressed into minutes.
- **Party:** 4-6 PCs, level 5+. Tests survival skills, environmental adaptation, and combat against creatures optimized for specific biomes. Favors rangers, druids, and adaptable fighters.

## Opening Presentation
- Before combat, arena mages demonstrate each biome with 10-second preview:
  - **"The SCORCHING DESERT—where water means life and heat means death!"** (blast of hot air hits crowd)
  - **"The FROZEN TUNDRA—where ice claims flesh and breath freezes!"** (temperature plummets, frost forms on rails)
  - **"The STRANGLING JUNGLE—where every vine hides venom!"** (vines creep across arena floor briefly)
  - **"The VOLCANIC CALDERA—where the earth itself BURNS!"** (ground cracks, steam erupts)
  - **"The FESTERING SWAMP—where disease lurks in every shadow!"** (putrid smell wafts up)
- Crowd gasps and recoils from each preview—"They must survive ALL FIVE?!"
- PCs learn rotation: Desert → Tundra → Jungle → Volcano → Swamp → repeat every 2 rounds.

## Biome Rotation (110-foot diameter circle, shifts every 2 rounds)

### Scorching Desert (Rounds 1-2, 11-12, 21-22)
**"Endless dunes under merciless sun"**
- **Heat Exhaustion:** All creatures without fire resistance make Constitution DC 13 save at end of each turn; fail = 1 level of exhaustion (max 2 during this biome, removed after shift).
- **Terrain:** Deep sand (difficult terrain), 3 rocky outcroppings (full cover, shade reduces heat DC by 5).
- **Sandstorm:** At initiative 15, 20-foot-radius sandstorm erupts (center moves 10 feet randomly); heavily obscured, Dex DC 14 or blinded until end of next turn.
- **Water Mirage:** 1 oasis pool (20-foot diameter) appears—drinking water restores 2d4+2 HP, cures 1 exhaustion.
- **Advantage:** Fire resistance/immunity negates heat; light armor no disadvantage; ranged visibility excellent.
- **Disadvantage:** Heavy armor = automatic fail on first heat save; water-dependent creatures take double exhaustion.

### Frozen Tundra (Rounds 3-4, 13-14, 23-24)
**"Blizzard winds and ice sheets"**
- **Frostbite:** All creatures without cold resistance make Constitution DC 13 save at end of each turn; fail = 1d6 cold damage and speed reduced by 10 feet until next shift.
- **Terrain:** Icy ground (Dex DC 12 Acrobatics or fall prone when hit), 4 ice formations (full cover, can be shattered with 15 HP damage).
- **Blizzard:** Entire arena is lightly obscured; ranged attack rolls beyond 30 feet have disadvantage.
- **Frozen Lake:** 30-foot-diameter frozen lake in center (DC 14 Dex save when crossed or fall through—1d6 cold damage, difficult terrain).
- **Advantage:** Cold resistance/immunity negates frostbite; ice-walk abilities ignore difficult terrain.
- **Disadvantage:** Fire spells deal half damage; water-based spells freeze (disadvantage on spell attacks).

### Strangling Jungle (Rounds 5-6, 15-16, 25-26)
**"Dense canopy and predatory plants"**
- **Choking Vines:** At initiative 10, vines erupt from ground; all creatures make Dex DC 14 save or restrained until they use action to escape (Strength/Acrobatics DC 14).
- **Terrain:** Dense undergrowth (difficult terrain, heavily obscured beyond 30 feet), 3 massive trees (30 feet tall, climbable DC 10, canopy provides half cover).
- **Poisonous Spores:** Breathing requires Constitution DC 12 save at start of each turn; fail = poisoned until end of next turn (disadvantage on attacks/checks).
- **Healing Plants:** 2 clusters of glowing flowers (Medicine DC 12 to harvest—grants potion of healing effect).
- **Advantage:** Climb speed useful; nature-based classes can identify plants (avoid spores, find healing).
- **Disadvantage:** Large creatures slowed by undergrowth (speed halved); visibility limited.

### Volcanic Caldera (Rounds 7-8, 17-18, 27-28)
**"Molten rock and toxic gases"**
- **Lava Vents:** At initiative 20, 3 random 10-foot squares erupt with lava (5d6 fire damage, Dex DC 15 for half); lava pools persist for 1 round.
- **Terrain:** Obsidian rock with lava rivers (20-foot-wide crisscrossing streams—6d10 fire damage to enter), 5 rock pillars (10-15 feet tall, safe from lava).
- **Sulfur Gas:** Breathing requires Constitution DC 13 save at start of each turn; fail = 1d8 poison damage and cannot take reactions until start of next turn.
- **Thermal Updrafts:** Creatures with fly speed gain +10 feet flying speed; jumping distance doubled (Athletics DC reduced by 5).
- **Advantage:** Fire immunity negates most hazards; jumping/flying creatures excel.
- **Disadvantage:** Cold-based spells disadvantage; water evaporates instantly (no *create water*).

### Festering Swamp (Rounds 9-10, 19-20, 29-30)
**"Murky water and diseased air"**
- **Disease Miasma:** All creatures make Constitution DC 14 save at start of each turn; fail = contract "Swamp Rot" (GM tracks who failed; no immediate effect during combat; onset 1 hour post-battle, then 1d6 necrotic damage every 8 hours until cured with *lesser restoration*). **GM Reminder:** Note failed saves on scratch paper for post-combat resolution.
- **Terrain:** Murky water waist-deep (difficult terrain, heavily obscured below water), 4 cypress trees (20 feet tall, roots provide half cover).
- **Quicksand Patches:** 3 hidden 10-foot-square patches (DC 15 Perception to spot, Strength DC 14 or sink—restrained, 5 feet deeper each round until submerged).
- **Leeches:** Entering water requires Constitution DC 12 save; fail = 1d4 piercing damage per turn from leeches (action to remove, DC 10 Medicine).
- **Advantage:** Swim speed useful; disease immunity negates miasma; undead/constructs immune to leeches.
- **Disadvantage:** Visibility terrible (attacks beyond 20 feet disadvantage); fire spells suppressed (half damage).

## Biome Shift Mechanic
- **At Initiative Count 20 on even-numbered rounds:** Weather/terrain transforms dramatically.
- **Warning:** At initiative 15 the round BEFORE shift, environmental cue appears: sand turns to frost, frost melts to mud, etc. Announcer shouts: "BIOME SHIFT IMMINENT!"
- **Positional Translation:**
  - High ground (trees, pillars) persists through shifts (tree in Jungle → ice formation in Tundra → rock outcropping in Desert).
  - Water areas (swamp, frozen lake) → become sand (desert) or rock (volcano).
  - Open ground translates logically (sand → ice → undergrowth → obsidian → mud).
- **Condition Carryover:** Some effects persist briefly (poisoned from jungle spores lasts 1 round into next biome; on fire persists until water/ice biome).

## Survival Tactics
- **Smart PCs Track Rotations:** "Jungle is next—look for healing plants!" "Volcano coming—get to high ground!"
- **Biome-Specific Strategies:**
  - Desert: Seek shade, conserve movement, use oasis water.
  - Tundra: Stay mobile (avoid prone), break ice formations for cover.
  - Jungle: Climb trees (escape vines), identify healing plants (Medicine check).
  - Volcano: Jump between pillars (avoid lava), use updrafts (fly/jump).
  - Swamp: Avoid quicksand (Perception), remove leeches quickly, ignore disease (short combat).

- **Enemy Exploitation:** Predators try to herd PCs into biome hazards:
  - Scorpions sting PCs toward sandstorm (blinding).
  - Winter Wolves breath weapon freezes PCs on ice (auto-prone).
  - Snakes grapple PCs in poisonous spore clouds.
  - Fire Snakes ignite PCs near lava vents.
  - Toads swallow PCs and hop into quicksand.

## Crowd Favor Hooks
- Survive all five biomes without gaining exhaustion or disease: +3 [[crowds_favor|Favor]] for perfect adaptation.
- Kill predator using biome against them (scorpion in quicksand, winter wolf in lava, shambling mound in desert): +2 Favor for environmental mastery.
- Harvest healing plants in Jungle mid-combat to save ally: +2 Favor for resourcefulness.
- Drink from oasis in Desert while surrounded by enemies: +2 Favor for audacity.
- Escape from quicksand/ice/vines without assistance: +1 Favor for self-reliance.
- [[panache|Panache]] strike that kills predator right as biome shifts: +3 Favor for timing.
- Use biome-specific advantage creatively (ride lava updraft to fly, freeze enemy in tundra, hide in jungle undergrowth): +2 Favor per creative use.
- Never fall prone despite ice/vines/quicksand: +2 Favor for perfect balance and awareness.

## Announcer Beats
- **Opening:** "FIVE WORLDS! ONE GAUNTLET! Can they master nature's fury—or PERISH in paradise lost?!"
- **First shift (Desert → Tundra):** "HEAT becomes ICE! Sand freezes! They shiver where they BURNED!"
- **Tundra → Jungle:** "Ice becomes LIFE! Vines erupt! The jungle CLAIMS them!"
- **Jungle → Volcano:** "Green becomes FLAME! The earth SPLITS! Magma rises!"
- **Volcano → Swamp:** "Fire becomes ROT! Ash turns to MUD! Disease spreads!"
- **Swamp → Desert:** "Filth becomes SAND! The cycle REPEATS! Can they ENDURE?!"
- **Predator adaptation:** "The Salamander BLAZES in its home! Unstoppable!"
- **Environmental kill:** "SWALLOWED by quicksand! The swamp claims another victim!"
- **Survival triumph:** "She drinks from the oasis! DEFIANT! Surrounded but SURVIVING!"
- **Victory:** "They've conquered EARTH ITSELF! Five biomes! Five battlefields! LEGENDS!"

## GM Tips
- **Visual Biome Shifts:** Use colored lighting (orange for desert, blue for tundra, green for jungle, red for volcano, brown for swamp) or layered maps.
- **Environmental Clocks:** Track biome duration visibly—players should feel time pressure.
- **Predator Timing:** Enemies appear during "their" biome; go dormant/retreat during others (scorpions burrow in tundra, wolves hide in volcano).
- **Survival Skills Shine:** Let rangers use *goodberry* (counts as oasis water), druids wild shape into biome-appropriate forms (salamander in volcano).
- **Exhaustion Management:** Cap exhaustion at 2 during any single biome (prevents instant death spiral), remove 1 exhaustion per biome shift.
- **Disease Tracking:** Swamp Rot doesn't affect combat (onset after battle) but creates tension—"Will I survive long enough to get cured?"
- **Rotation Reminder:** Display biome order: Desert (🏜️) → Tundra (❄️) → Jungle (🌿) → Volcano (🌋) → Swamp (💀).

## Aftermath Seeds
- **Elemental Attunement:** PCs who survived all five biomes gain "Nature's Chosen" boon—advantage on saves vs. environmental hazards for 1 week, immune to normal extreme heat/cold.
- **Patron Interest:** Druid circle impressed by "harmony with nature"—offers initiation into circle (learn druid cantrip, gain herbalism proficiency).
- **Rumor:** The biome magic was stolen from ancient elemental fey courts—courts demand tribute or the PCs' heads.
- **Downtime:** Predator trophies can be harvested: Scorpion Venom (poison damage coating), Winter Wolf Pelt (cold resistance cloak), Salamander Scale (fire resistance armor), Shambling Mound Vine (healing potion ingredient).
- **Injury:** PC who failed multiple biome saves develops "Environmental Trauma"—disadvantage on saves vs. one environment type (player chooses which terrified them most).
- **Legendary Moment:** If PCs adapted perfectly to each biome (used healing plants, drank oasis water, exploited terrain), naturalist scholars request interview for survival manual (expertise in Survival skill).
- **Political:** Arena's compressed biome magic destabilizes local weather—unexpected snowstorm in Tarsus causes panic, arena blamed (PR crisis or opportunity to help city).
