# The Memory Crucible

- **Hook:** "WITNESS! REMEMBER! SURVIVE!" The arena floor displays a complex sequence of glowing symbols for 30 seconds, then goes dark. Enemies attack in waves, but can only be harmed by striking them in the EXACT ORDER the symbols appeared. Wrong order = immune. PCs must memorize the pattern while fighting for their lives. Each wave adds NEW symbols to remember. Can their minds hold the sequence before the enemies overwhelm them?
- **Party:** 3-5 PCs. Tests memory under pressure, teamwork to share/verify remembered patterns, and fighting while thinking. The ultimate "Simon Says" meets deadly combat.

## Arena Layout

- Circular arena (70-foot diameter) with illuminated floor tiles (70 tiles total, arranged in 7 concentric rings of 10 tiles each).
- **Tile Grid:** Each tile is 7 feet diameter, carved with a unique symbol (dragon, sword, star, flame, water, etc.—70 unique symbols total).
- **Central Pillar:** 15-foot-tall stone pillar in center, topped with arcane crystal that projects light patterns onto floor tiles.
- **No Cover:** Arena is completely open—nowhere to hide, forces constant movement.
- **Crowd Visibility:** Elevated seating provides perfect view of floor—crowd sees tiles light up, watches PCs struggle to remember.

## The Pattern Mechanic (CORE CHALLENGE)

**How It Works:**

### Phase 1: Pattern Display (30 seconds)
- At start of combat (before initiative), crystal pulses and **5 random floor tiles light up in sequence** (1 second each, then dark for 1 second, repeat cycle 3 times total).
- Example sequence: Dragon → Flame → Star → Sword → Water.
- PCs have 30 seconds to MEMORIZE the sequence (in real-time—set timer at table).
- Tiles then go DARK and stay dark until combat ends.

### Phase 2: Combat Begins
- Enemies spawn and attack.
- **Immunity Rule:** Enemies are immune to ALL damage UNLESS attacked in pattern order.
- **Pattern Striking:** PCs must physically stand on floor tiles in correct sequence order when attacking adjacent enemy.
  - PC stands on Dragon tile → attacks Enemy #1 (damage applies, counts as "1st in sequence").
  - NEXT PC stands on Flame tile → attacks Enemy #2 or #1 (damage applies, counts as "2nd in sequence").
  - If wrong tile, attack automatically MISSES (enemy phases through damage, no immunity bypass).
- **Sequence Resets:** After 5th tile (Water) is used, sequence resets—next attack must start at Dragon again.
- **Movement Economy:** Standing on tile costs movement (PCs must navigate to correct tiles, then attack).

### Phase 3: Pattern Expansion (Every 3 Rounds)
- At initiative count 20 on rounds 3, 6, 9, etc., crystal pulses again—**adds 2 MORE symbols to sequence**.
- Round 3: Sequence becomes Dragon → Flame → Star → Sword → Water → **Tree → Moon** (7 symbols).
- Round 6: Sequence becomes Dragon → Flame → Star → Sword → Water → Tree → Moon → **Sun → Shield** (9 symbols).
- Round 9: Sequence becomes Dragon → ... → **Crown → Lightning** (11 symbols).
- Each expansion displays for 15 seconds (quicker than initial), then dark again.
- PCs must REMEMBER expanding pattern while fighting.

## Memory Challenges

**Pressure:**
- Combat continues DURING pattern display (enemies still attack while tiles light up).
- PCs must divide attention: watch pattern OR defend themselves.
- Teammates can split tasks: "You memorize, I'll protect you!"

**Verification:**
- No way to verify remembered pattern except by trying it in combat.
- Wrong tile = wasted turn (missed attack).
- Team must communicate: "I think it's Dragon-Flame-Star..." "No, Flame-Dragon-Star!"

**Expansion Stress:**
- As pattern grows (5 → 7 → 9 → 11 symbols), memorization becomes exponentially harder.
- By Round 9, most parties will struggle with 11-symbol sequence.

## Enemies (Immune Without Pattern)

### 3 PCs:
- **Wave 1 (Rounds 1-3):** 4 **Phantom Warriors** (CR 1/2; immune to damage unless pattern used, basic melee attacks).
- **Wave 2 (Rounds 4-6):** 3 **Spectral Knights** (CR 2; immune + multiattack, higher HP).
- **Wave 3 (Rounds 7+):** 1 **Memory Devourer** (reskin Intellect Devourer; CR 3; immune + psychic attacks that cause INT damage, eats memories—on hit, DC 14 INT save or forget one symbol from pattern).

### 4-5 PCs:
- **Wave 1:** 6 Phantom Warriors.
- **Wave 2:** 4 Spectral Knights + 2 Phantom Archers (ranged attacks, stay mobile).
- **Wave 3:** 2 Memory Devourers + 1 **Pattern Warden** (reskin Stone Golem; CR 6; immune + massive HP, only damaged by PERFECT pattern sequences—no mistakes allowed).

### Enemy Tactics:
- **Phantom Warriors:** Spread out across arena, force PCs to move between tiles.
- **Spectral Knights:** Guard key tiles (Dragon, first symbol), block access.
- **Phantom Archers:** Attack PCs standing still (memorizing pattern), interrupt concentration.
- **Memory Devourers:** Target PCs who've successfully used pattern multiple times (steal their knowledge).
- **Pattern Warden:** Boss enemy, only appears Round 7+, massive threat—requires team coordination to damage.

## Tile Navigation Strategy

**Optimal Movement:**
- Tiles are arranged in rings—plan efficient paths to hit symbols in sequence.
- Dragon tile might be in Ring 3, Flame in Ring 5—requires 14 feet of movement.
- Melee PCs (30 feet speed) can reach 2-3 tiles per turn.
- Flying/mobile PCs have advantage (dash to correct tiles faster).

**Team Coordination:**
- Designate "sequence leader" who calls out next tile: "I'm on Dragon, you take Flame!"
- Split sequence across party—PC 1 does Dragon-Flame-Star, PC 2 does Sword-Water.
- If one PC forgets, others cover their symbols.

## Memorization Tools (Player-Facing)

**Allowed Aids:**
- Players can take REAL NOTES during 30-second display (simulates character memory).
- Mnemonics encouraged: "Dragon Flies Swiftly Swinging Water" (first letters: D-F-S-S-W).
- Physical tokens: Players can arrange dice/tokens in order to remember.

**Forbidden Aids:**
- No video recording (unfair advantage).
- No looking up previous notes after tiles go dark (must use real-time memory).

## Objectives

- **Primary:** Defeat all three waves of enemies using pattern correctly.
- **Secondary:** Complete fight without any PC forgetting pattern (zero wrong-tile attacks).
- **Bonus:** Defeat Pattern Warden (Wave 3 boss) using 9+ symbol sequence perfectly (hardest challenge).

## Crowd Favor Hooks

- Memorize initial 5-symbol pattern on first try (no mistakes): +2 [[crowds_favor|Favor]] for sharp mind.
- Coordinate sequence across team (3+ PCs using different symbols in one round): +2 Favor for teamwork.
- Successfully recall expanded pattern (7+ symbols) after Round 3 addition: +2 Favor for memory.
- Continue fighting while memorizing new pattern (attack during display phase): +1 Favor for multitasking.
- Resist Memory Devourer's memory-steal attack (save vs. INT damage): +1 Favor for mental fortitude.
- Defeat Pattern Warden using 9-symbol sequence with zero mistakes: +4 Favor for perfection.
- [[panache|Panache]] declare pattern aloud before executing ("Watch as I strike in perfect order!"): +3 Favor for showmanship.
- One PC memorizes entire 11-symbol sequence alone and recites to team: +3 Favor for genius.
- Team completes combat without single wrong-tile attack: +5 Favor for flawless execution.

## Pattern Complexity Scaling

**5 Symbols (Rounds 1-2):** Manageable—most parties succeed.
**7 Symbols (Rounds 3-5):** Challenging—mistakes start happening.
**9 Symbols (Rounds 6-8):** Very hard—team must split memory load.
**11 Symbols (Round 9+):** Brutal—near impossible for single person, requires perfect teamwork.

## Memory Devourer Special Ability

**Memory Drain:**
- On hit (psychic attack), target makes DC 14 Intelligence save.
- **Failure:** Target forgets ONE symbol from pattern (player must discard one note/token). If they have none written, they simply "forget" and must rely on teammates.
- **Critical Failure (natural 1):** Target forgets TWO symbols.
- This ability creates PANIC—PCs lose their reference and must rely on allies.

## Announcer Beats

- Opening: "THE PATTERN APPEARS! MEMORIZE OR DIE! Thirty seconds! WATCH!"
- Pattern display: "Dragon... FLAME... Star... Sword... WATER! Do they SEE? Do they REMEMBER?!"
- First correct attack: "YES! Dragon tile! The warrior strikes TRUE! The pattern WORKS!"
- First wrong tile: "NO! Wrong symbol! The blade passes through shadow! Wasted!"
- Pattern expansion (Round 3): "MORE SYMBOLS! The pattern GROWS! Can their minds HOLD?!"
- Memory Devourer hit: "Their memories STOLEN! They forget! Panic sets in!"
- Pattern Warden appears: "THE GUARDIAN OF ORDER! Nine symbols to defeat it—ONE MISTAKE and it's INVULNERABLE!"
- Perfect sequence: "FLAWLESS! Every strike in order! The Warden BLEEDS!"
- Victory: "They've conquered MEMORY ITSELF! The pattern complete! MINDS OF STEEL!"
- Defeat: "Their memories fail! Confusion reigns! The arena claims another!"

## GM Tips

- **Real-Time Display:** Use VTT lighting effects or physical markers (colored dice on map) to show tiles lighting up. Set visible 30-second timer.
- **Pattern Recording:** Write pattern on hidden note card for reference—players shouldn't see it after display ends.
- **Wrong-Tile Clarity:** When PC uses wrong tile, describe dramatically: "Your sword swings through the warrior—it's insubstantial, immune! Wrong symbol!"
- **Damage Tracking:** Only track damage from attacks made on correct tiles in sequence—ignore others entirely.
- **Expansion Tension:** When pattern expands (Round 3), pause combat briefly, display new pattern, then resume—builds pressure.
- **Memory Roleplay:** When PC forgets (Memory Devourer hit), have PLAYER hand you one note card/token—physically reinforces loss.
- **Team Communication:** Encourage LOUD callouts—"I'm on Dragon!" "Flame is next!" Simulate chaos of battle + memory test.
- **Symbol Variety:** Use evocative symbols (Dragon, Flame, Star)—easier to remember than abstract shapes (Circle 1, Triangle 2).

## Tactical Elements

- **Action Economy:** Moving to correct tile + attacking costs movement and action—PCs must optimize pathing.
- **Sequence Reset:** After 5 attacks in pattern, resets—allows multiple PCs to attack simultaneously if they coordinate.
- **Flying Advantage:** PCs with fly speed can reach distant tiles faster (Ring 1 to Ring 7 in one move).
- **Memory Devourer Priority:** MUST kill these fast—if they steal memories from multiple PCs, team coordination collapses.
- **Pattern Warden Tank:** Boss has massive HP—requires entire team executing 9-symbol sequence perfectly over multiple rounds.

## Aftermath Seeds

- **Enhanced Memory:** PC who memorized 9+ symbols gains "Eidetic Training" trait—advantage on Intelligence checks to recall information for 1 week.
- **Patron Interest:** Scholar impressed by memory performance—offers "Mind Palace" training (proficiency in History if not already, or expertise if proficient).
- **Rumor:** Memory Crucible was ancient wizard's aptitude test—those who pass gain access to arcane library with powerful (dangerous) tomes.
- **Downtime:** Floor tiles can be purchased (50 gp each)—function as decorative mosaic or used to create "memory game" for downtime training (advantage on next INT check if practiced).
- **Injury:** PC hit by Memory Devourer 3+ times develops temporary amnesia—forgets minor details of last session (cosmetic, roleplay opportunity, fades after long rest).
- **Legendary Moment:** If team completed with zero wrong tiles, wizards' college invites PCs to lecture on "Mental Fortitude Under Duress" (500 gp stipend, gain academic contacts).
- **Political:** Arena's use of memory magic concerns authorities—mind magic is regulated, investigation into legality of fight ensues.
- **Cursed Symbol:** PC who stood on Dragon tile 5+ times develops "Symbol Obsession"—occasionally sketches dragon symbol unconsciously (cosmetic, unsettling, fades after 1 week).
- **Loot:** Memory Devourer drops **Circlet of Clear Thought** (advantage on Intelligence saves, attunement required, +1 INT up to max 20).
- **Pattern Warden Core:** If defeated, yields **Memory Crystal** (contains recorded pattern, can replay once—useful for training, sells for 200 gp to collectors).
