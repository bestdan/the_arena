# Polymorphic Chaos

- **Hook:** Arcane academies sponsor a "Transformation Trial"—combatants and beasts alike warped by unpredictable polymorph magics. The crowd bets on what emerges from each shimmer. Who fights as themselves, and who becomes the beast?
- **Party:** 4-6 PCs, level 5+. Emphasize adaptation and creative problem-solving when shapes shift.

## Arena Layout
- Circular pit (80-foot diameter) with concentric rings marking safe zones (inner 20 feet, middle 30-40 feet, outer 60-80 feet).
- Three Polymorphic Fonts (glowing crystalline pillars, 10 feet tall) positioned at 12, 4, and 8 o'clock around the middle ring.
- Fonts pulse every 3 rounds; all creatures within 20 feet must save or be polymorphed (Wisdom save DC 14; lasts until dispelled, creature drops to 0 HP in new form, or until Font is destroyed).
- Scattered cover: stone slabs and bronze statues that can't be moved but provide half-cover.

## Polymorph Tables (roll d6 when Font pulses)
**Beasts (CR 1-2):**
1. Giant Toad (swallow attacks)
2. Giant Constrictor Snake (grapple focus)
3. Brown Bear (multiattack, climb)
4. Giant Octopus (water-breathing, reach)
5. Elk (charge damage)
6. Giant Vulture (fly, pack tactics)

**Monstrosities (for enemies, CR 2-3):**
1. Basilisk (petrifying gaze)
2. Grick (tentacles, damage resistance)
3. Phase Spider (ethereal jaunt)

## Enemies (shifting hunters)
- 2 Transmuter Mages (use Mage stat block; cast *polymorph* at will on allies/enemies; stay mobile to avoid Fonts).
- 4 Polymorphed Gladiators (start as CR 1 Thugs; after first Font pulse, GM rolls on Beasts table for each).
- 1 Chaos Hound (reskin Hell Hound with random damage type each attack: roll d6 for fire/cold/lightning/acid/poison/thunder).
- **Flex:** For 4 PCs, remove 1 Transmuter and 1 Polymorphed Gladiator. For 6 PCs, add 2 more Polymorphed Gladiators and give Chaos Hound legendary resistance (1/day).

## Font Mechanics
- **Pulse Trigger:** Fonts pulse at the end of rounds 3, 6, and 9.
- **Saving Throw:** All creatures within 20 feet of a pulsing Font must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom save or be polymorphed into a random beast (PCs roll on Beasts table; enemies use Monstrosities or Beasts at GM discretion).
- **Destroying Fonts:** AC 15, 30 HP, immunity to psychic and poison. Destroying a Font stops its pulses and releases a 15-foot-radius shimmer wave (all polymorphed creatures within range revert to original form).
- **Voluntary Fail:** Creatures can choose to fail the save and embrace the polymorph (tactical choice).

## Crowd Favor Hooks
- Win a fight while polymorphed into a creature CR lower than your level: +2 [[crowds_favor|Favor]].
- Destroy a Font to save an ally from polymorph: +1 Favor.
- Voluntarily fail a save and immediately use the new form's signature ability (toad swallow, snake grapple): +2 Favor for boldness.
- Kill a Transmuter while they're mid-cast: +1 Favor.
- Complete the bout without ever being polymorphed: +2 Favor (risky positioning).

## Hazards and Tactics
- **Shimmer Zones:** Fonts create 20-foot hazard zones; tactical positioning is key.
- **Form Strategy:** Smart use of beast forms (fly as vulture to escape, grapple as snake, swallow as toad) earns crowd approval.
- **Dispel Desperation:** Transmuters will try to *dispel magic* on PCs in powerful beast forms; protect your forms or adapt.
- **Chain Polymorphs:** A creature can be polymorphed multiple times if hit by multiple Fonts or Transmuter spells; each new form replaces the previous.

## Announcer Beats
- Opening: "Welcome to Polymorphic Chaos! Flesh bends! Bones twist! Will they master the shapes—or be mastered by them?"
- First Font pulse: "The crystals flare! Reality warps! A gladiator sprouts fur and fangs!"
- Mid-fight: "A bear mauls a Transmuter! No—wait—the bear was Kallista three seconds ago!"
- Font destroyed: "The Font shatters! Bodies snap back to flesh! The crowd gasps!"
- Climax: "Two Fonts remain! Every step is a gamble! Who dares the shimmer?"

## GM Tips
- Pre-roll polymorph forms for NPCs to keep pace; let PCs roll their own for agency.
- Remind PCs they retain their mental stats (Int, Wis, Cha) but lose class abilities while polymorphed.
- Track HP separately for polymorphed forms; dropping to 0 HP in beast form reverts to original form with previous HP.
- Encourage creative tactics: use toad's swallow on a Transmuter, fly as vulture to kite, grapple with snake to pin.
- If a PC panics about losing their form, have the announcer shout encouragement or the crowd chant their name.

## Aftermath Seeds
- Patron interest: Arcane university professor impressed by adaptive tactics; offers magical research stipend.
- Rumor: One of the Transmuters was actually polymorphed the entire time—a dragon in disguise testing the arena's wards.
- Downtime: Black market vendor offers "Stabilized Polymorph Elixir" (potion of *polymorph* with user-chosen beast form, one use).
- Lingering effect: PC who spent most of the fight polymorphed develops a minor quirk (dreams of running on four legs, craves raw meat, etc.).
