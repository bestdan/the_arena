# Tremors Below

- **Hook:** The arena floor conceals a network of tunnels. Massive burrowing beasts erupt from below, dragging victims into the dark. Patrons bet on who gets swallowed first. The crowd feels the vibrations and screams warnings—but can the gladiators react in time?
- **Party:** 4-6 PCs, level 6+. Emphasize mobility, tremorsense awareness, and fighting while the ground betrays you.

## Arena Layout
- Sandy pit (100-foot diameter, 5-foot-deep loose sand covering entire floor—difficult terrain for all).
- No permanent cover; scattered boulders (can be climbed for height advantage, AC 17, 30 HP, provide half-cover).
- **Tunnel Network:** Hidden beneath the sand; creatures with burrow speed can emerge anywhere as part of their movement.
- **Tremor Markers:** At initiative count 20 (losing ties), GM rolls 2d6 to determine where a tunnel opens (clock positions: 1-12). Sand shifts visibly 1 round before a creature emerges (Perception DC 12 to notice, allows readied actions).

## Tremorsense Mechanic
- All burrowing creatures use tremorsense (60 feet) to detect PCs on or moving through sand.
- PCs can reduce tremorsense detection by:
  - Standing still (no movement on their turn): tremorsense disadvantage.
  - Standing on a boulder (off the sand): immune to tremorsense while stationary.
  - Misty Step, Fly, or similar abilities: bypass sand entirely.

## Enemies (subterranean hunters)
- 2 Ankhegs (CR 2; acid spray, burrow 30 feet, grab and pull underground).
- 1 Bulette (CR 5; landshark, deadly leap, burrow 40 feet).
- 1 Purple Worm Spawn (reskin Young Remorhaz as half-size purple worm; CR 5, swallow ability, burrow 30 feet, poison sting).
- 2 Umber Hulk Spawn (reskin Umber Hulks to CR 3 juveniles; confusing gaze, burrow 20 feet, tremorsense).
- **Flex:** For 4 PCs, remove 1 Ankheg and both Umber Hulk Spawn (replace with 3 Giant Centipedes, CR 1/4). For 6 PCs, upgrade Purple Worm Spawn to full Young Purple Worm (CR 7+) and add 1 more Ankheg.

## Burrow Tactics (GM Reference)
- **Ankhegs:** Surface, spray acid (30-foot line), burrow back down. Reposition between attacks.
- **Bulette:** Leap attack (up to 30 feet from burrow point, lands prone near PC, multiattack). Burrow if heavily damaged.
- **Purple Worm Spawn:** Target isolated PCs; attempt swallow (restrained inside, acid damage each round). Surface and stay visible to terrify the crowd.
- **Umber Hulk Spawn:** Surface, use confusing gaze (Charisma save DC 13), claw multiattack, burrow to new position.

## Crowd Favor Hooks
- Dodge a burrowing creature's surprise attack with a readied action: +1 [[crowds_favor_mechanic|Favor]] for anticipation.
- Land a critical hit on a creature as it surfaces (before it acts): +2 Favor for quick reflexes.
- Get swallowed and cut your way out in one turn: +3 Favor for dramatic escape.
- Collapse a boulder onto a creature as it burrows beneath (AC 17, 30 HP; when destroyed, deals 3d6 to creature below): +2 Favor.
- Kill a Bulette mid-leap (readied attack while it's airborne): +2 Favor for trick shot.
- Stand on a boulder and survive the entire fight without touching the sand: +1 Favor for playing it safe.

## Hazards and Environment
- **Sand Pit:** Entire floor is difficult terrain; movement costs double. Running provokes tremorsense detection.
- **Tremor Warnings:** Initiative count 20, GM signals next burrow point (clock position); PC Perception DC 12 to ready an action.
- **Swallow Mechanics:** Purple Worm Spawn can swallow Medium or smaller creatures (restrained, 3d6 acid per turn, escape DC 14 Strength or be cut out by dealing 15+ damage from inside).
- **Boulder Collapse:** PCs can shove boulders (Athletics DC 15) to topple them onto burrowing zones (3d6 bludgeoning, Dex save DC 13).

## Announcer Beats
- Opening: "The sands shift! The earth hungers! Welcome to TREMORS BELOW! Can they read the ground—or will it swallow them whole?!"
- First tremor: "A ripple! A rumble! Sand explodes as mandibles rise! The Ankheg strikes!"
- Bulette leap: "THE LANDSHARK SOARS! Bodies scatter! Teeth descend!"
- Swallow attempt: "NO! The worm's maw closes! Can they carve free?!"
- Mid-fight: "The tunnels multiply! Nowhere is safe! The crowd feels every quake!"
- Victory: "They stand victorious atop the trembling earth! The beasts lie broken! Tarsus salutes its seismic survivors!"

## GM Tips
- Use poker chips or tokens at "clock positions" to mark tremor warnings; let PCs strategize between tremors.
- Narrate the crowd's reactions to vibrations: "The stands shake! People grip their seats!"
- Encourage PCs to communicate: "I see sand shifting at 3 o'clock!" "Ready your arrows!"
- Let PCs experiment with tremorsense: "If I stand still, does it lose me?" (Yes, with disadvantage.)
- If a PC gets swallowed, make it cinematic: describe the acid, the darkness, the desperate cutting from within.
- Track burrow positions on a simple diagram; show PCs where creatures were last seen to build tension.

## Aftermath Seeds
- Patron interest: Underground mining consortium impressed by "seismic awareness"; offers contract to clear monster-infested tunnels (lucrative but deadly).
- Rumor: The tremor network connects to ancient catacombs beneath Tarsus—treasures and terrors both rumored to sleep below.
- Downtime: Ankheg carapace can be harvested (AC +1 to light/medium armor if crafted by armorer, 2d4 days, 50 gp cost).
- Injury: PC swallowed by Purple Worm Spawn develops "Worm-Scarred" reputation; nightmares of being digested, minor phobia of enclosed spaces.
- Political: Rival arena discovers the tunnel network was artificially expanded—sabotage accusations fly, investigation subplot opens.
