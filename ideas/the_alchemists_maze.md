# The Alchemist's Maze

## Hook
An alchemist patron has transformed the arena into a bubbling laboratory. Color-coded pipes pump mysterious liquids across the floor, and the gladiators must mix the right potions to open doors, disable traps, and defeat a creature immune to normal damage. Chemistry class never had so many teeth.

## The Potion System

### Primary Colors
Three colored liquids flow through pipes:
- **Red Liquid** (fire essence): Deals 1d6 fire damage on contact
- **Blue Liquid** (frost essence): Deals 1d6 cold damage, slows (half speed 1 round)
- **Yellow Liquid** (lightning essence): Deals 1d6 lightning damage, chains to adjacent creatures

### Mixing (Secondary Colors)
Liquids can be combined at **Mixing Stations** (3 in arena):
- **Red + Blue = Purple**: Healing potion (2d4+2 HP)
- **Red + Yellow = Orange**: Haste potion (extra action for 1 round)
- **Blue + Yellow = Green**: Poison (2d6 poison damage, thrown 20 ft)

### Mixing Mechanic
- Action at Mixing Station + DC 10 Intelligence check
- Success = desired potion (one use)
- Failure = unstable mixture (explodes for 1d6 random damage type in 5 ft radius)
- Can only hold 2 potions at once

## The Chromatic Ooze (Boss)
**Chromatic Ooze** (Ochre Jelly stats, CR 2, but with immunities)
- Immune to all damage EXCEPT the color it's NOT currently displaying
- Cycles through Red → Blue → Yellow every 2 rounds
- **When Red**: Immune to fire, vulnerable to cold and lightning
- **When Blue**: Immune to cold, vulnerable to fire and lightning
- **When Yellow**: Immune to lightning, vulnerable to fire and cold

### Ooze Tactics
- Stays near pipe junctions (can absorb primary liquids to heal 1d6)
- Splits when reduced to half HP (each half is smaller, same color)
- If hit with the color it's displaying, it GROWS (regains 1d6 HP)

## Arena Layout
- 60 x 60 ft laboratory arena
- **3 Mixing Stations** (north, center, south)—each adjacent to different pipe colors
- **Pipe Valves** (6 total)—can be turned to redirect liquid flow (action + DC 12 Strength)
- **Central Drain Pit** (15 ft diameter)—all liquids eventually flow here, toxic sludge (2d6 acid damage per round)
- **Exit Door** (east wall)—requires inserting Purple, Orange, AND Green potions to unlock

### Pipe Routes
- Red pipes run along north wall
- Blue pipes run along south wall
- Yellow pipes run through center
- Valves can redirect liquid into enemy paths or away from allies

## Enemies
- **Chromatic Ooze** (described above)
- **2 Alchemical Homunculi** (Homunculus stats, CR 0)—carry random potions, explode on death (random color, 1d6 in 5 ft)
- **1 Mad Apprentice** (Mage stats, CR 6, but only knows: Fire Bolt, Ray of Frost, Shocking Grasp)—matches attacks to Ooze's weakness (helping it heal if party isn't paying attention)

### Mad Apprentice Tactics
- Actively tries to HEAL the Ooze by matching colors
- Must be killed or incapacitated to stop
- If grabbed, will bargain: reveals Ooze's color cycle pattern

## Crowd's Favor Opportunities
- Successfully mix a potion: +1 Favor
- Hit Ooze with correct vulnerability: +1 Favor
- Redirect pipes to damage enemies: Panache roll
- Use all three secondary potions on the door at once: +2 Favor (efficiency)
- Throw unstable mixture intentionally as a bomb: Panache roll (risky but flashy)

## Scaling
- **3 PCs**: No Mad Apprentice, Ooze has 30 HP, 2 Mixing Stations
- **5 PCs**: Add 2 more Homunculi, Ooze has 50 HP, Mad Apprentice has Shield spell

## Environmental Hazards
- **Pipe Bursts**: Every 3 rounds, a random pipe bursts—10 ft line, 1d6 damage of that color
- **Slippery Floor**: Areas near pipes are difficult terrain (spilled liquids)
- **Fume Clouds**: Mixing station area fills with fumes—DC 12 Con save or poisoned for 1 round

## Announcer Beats
- "CHEMISTRY in the arena! Mix or DIE, gladiators!"
- Failed mix: "An EXPLOSION! Perhaps they should have paid attention in SCHOOL!"
- Correct vulnerability hit: "YES! They've cracked the Ooze's weakness! BRILLIANT!"
- Wrong color hit: "Oh NO! The Ooze GROWS! Wrong COLOR, gladiators!"
- Door unlocked: "All three potions! The formula is COMPLETE! ESCAPE awaits!"

## Alchemist Patron (Balcony)
- **Callix the Chromatic**—eccentric, multicolored robes, takes notes
- Cheers for successful mixes, groans at failures
- If impressed: offers apprenticeship (downtime: learn Alchemist's Supplies proficiency)
- Shouts hints in alchemical jargon: "Complementary colors OPPOSE!" (means use opposite colors)

## GM Tips
- Use colored tokens or markers for pipe tracking
- Ooze's color should be visually obvious (describe its hue shifting)
- Let players experiment—first failed mix should be dramatic but not lethal
- If party ignores mixing and just fights, Ooze becomes nearly unkillable

## Aftermath Seeds
- Successful mixing = gain 2 random potions (leftover)
- Chromatic Ooze residue = crafting component for color-changing items
- Mad Apprentice's notes = recipe for one secondary potion (downtime crafting)
- Callix offers future challenges: "Next time... FOUR colors. Quaternary compounds!"
