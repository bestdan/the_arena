# The Harvest Moon

## Hook
The arena has been transformed into a corrupted farmland. Twisted crops grow from enchanted soil, and the gladiators must harvest five **Moonlight Fruits** before the werewolf pack awakens at the "full moon" (round 10). But the fruits are guarded, and picking them triggers dangers.

## The Harvest
Five **Moonlight Fruits** hang from twisted trees scattered across the arena:
- Picking a fruit requires an action and DC 10 Nature/Strength check
- Each picked fruit glows and must be carried to the central **Offering Altar**
- A PC can carry 2 fruits max (one per hand)—can't use two-handed weapons while carrying

### Fruit Locations & Guardians
1. **Bramble Fruit** (northwest): Surrounded by thorns—2d4 piercing to reach it
2. **Venom Fruit** (northeast): Hangs over snake pit—DC 12 Acrobatics or fall in (1d6 + poisoned)
3. **High Fruit** (center): 15 ft up in tree—requires climbing or creative solution
4. **Buried Fruit** (southeast): Underground—must dig (3 actions total) while scarecrow watches
5. **Frozen Fruit** (southwest): Encased in ice—10 fire damage or 5 rounds of chipping to free

### Scarecrow Guardians
Each fruit area has a **Scarecrow** (CR 1) that animates when a PC gets within 15 ft. Scarecrows don't attack unless fruit is touched—they watch, waiting.

## The Moon Timer
- Round 1-3: **New Moon**—dim light, scarecrows dormant until triggered
- Round 4-6: **Crescent Moon**—scarecrows become aggressive (attack even without fruit trigger)
- Round 7-9: **Half Moon**—werewolf howls heard, PCs have disadvantage on hearing-based Perception
- Round 10+: **Full Moon**—werewolf pack awakens (see below)

### Full Moon Awakening
If 5 fruits aren't on the altar by round 10:
- **2 Werewolves** (CR 3) emerge from arena gates
- They hunt the fruit carriers first
- Every 2 rounds after, add 1 more werewolf (max 4)

### Victory Condition
Place all 5 fruits on the Offering Altar. Altar accepts them and a portal opens—gladiators can escape to victory, or stay to fight the werewolves for bonus glory.

## Arena Layout
- 80 x 80 ft corrupted farmland—difficult terrain in "crop rows" (half movement)
- Dirt paths between rows (normal movement)
- 5 twisted trees at listed positions
- Central **Offering Altar** (stone circle, 10 ft diameter)
- **Moonlight Dial** visible overhead—shows current moon phase (tension builder)

## Environmental Hazards
- **Crop Hands**: Every 3 rounds, corrupted crops grab at PCs—DC 12 Strength or restrained until end of turn
- **Poisoned Irrigation**: 10 ft channels of dark water—wading through = DC 11 Con or poisoned
- **Animated Pitchforks**: 3 pitchforks float and attack anyone carrying fruit (use Flying Sword stats, CR 1/4)

## Crowd's Favor Opportunities
- Pick a fruit while under attack: Panache roll
- Deliver 2 fruits at once to altar: +2 Favor
- Save an ally carrying fruit from werewolf: +2 Favor
- Fight werewolves voluntarily after altar completion: +1 Favor per werewolf killed
- Use Moonlight Fruit as improvised weapon (loses the fruit!): Panache roll for absurdity

## Scaling
- **3 PCs**: 3 fruits needed, 4 scarecrows, 1 werewolf at full moon
- **5 PCs**: 5 fruits needed, 5 scarecrows, 3 werewolves at full moon

## Announcer Beats
- "The MOON rises! Our gladiators must HARVEST before the BEASTS awaken!"
- Crescent Moon: "The scarecrows STIR! They no longer wait politely!"
- Half Moon: "Do you HEAR that? The pack is HUNGRY!"
- Full Moon: "TOO LATE! The wolves are LOOSE! RUN or FIGHT!"
- All fruits delivered: "The altar ACCEPTS! But will they flee—or seek MORE glory?"

## GM Tips
- Use a visible timer (candle, sand timer, or d10 countdown)
- Describe the moon visually changing overhead
- Scarecrows should be creepy—describe them "watching" before they animate
- If party struggles, have a fruit roll toward them after a scarecrow is killed (mercy mechanic)

## Aftermath Seeds
- Werewolf pelts worth 50 gp each—but mark the bearer as "wolf-hunter"
- Moonlight Fruit seeds can be planted—downtime activity to grow moonlight lanterns
- Surviving scarecrows remember their killers—may appear in future sessions (same scarecrows, patched up)
