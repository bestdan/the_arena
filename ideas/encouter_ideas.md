## Party Composition
- 5 Level 2 Player Characters
- Supporting NPCs (disposable/at risk)

---

## Encounter Concept Options

### Option 1: The Gauntlet Run
**Theme:** Speed, endurance, and crowd-pleasing momentum

**Setup:**
The Arena floor is divided into three zones with increasingly difficult enemies. The party must fight their way through while a sand timer (10 rounds) counts down. Completing zones faster = more Crowd's Favor.

**Enemies:**
- **Zone 1:** 4 Goblins with nets and crude weapons (CR 1/4 each)
- **Zone 2:** 2 Hobgoblins with shields forming a defensive line (CR 1/2 each)
- **Zone 3:** 1 Ogre chained to center post + 2 Goblin handlers with whips (CR 2 + 2x CR 1/4)

**NPC Support:**
- 2-3 fellow gladiators (use Guard statblock) who can help in early zones but may flee or fall before the Ogre

**Crowd Mechanics:**
- Completing Zone 1 in 3 rounds or less: +1 Favor to all
- Finishing Zone 2 without anyone dropping to 0 HP: +1 Favor to party MVP
- Killing the Ogre with a declared Panache attack: +2 Favor to attacker

**Drama Hooks:**
- Ogre breaks its chain at half HP, becomes more dangerous but mobile
- Goblin handlers try to unlock other cages if ignored
- Crowd throws items (healing potions, weapons, rocks) based on performance

---

### Option 2: The Beast and Its Masters
**Theme:** Target priority and environmental awareness

**Setup:**
A trained Owlbear is released with its handler-trainers. The beast is savage but responds to commands. The trainers use it tactically while staying out of direct combat. Arena floor has scattered obstacles (pillars, weapon racks, partial walls).

**Enemies:**
- **1 Owlbear** (CR 3) - The main threat, very dangerous at Level 2
- **3 Beast Handlers** (use Scout statblock, CR 1/2 each) - Stay at range, command the beast, use nets/bolas to disable PCs

**NPC Support:**
- Merryn (Archer, if she wasn't present in Session 2) OR
- Rohm + 1 of the young steppes folk (Tovo?) - Rohm will protect the youth at all costs

**Tactical Elements:**
- Handlers can use their action to command the Owlbear to attack a specific target or use its multiattack
- If all handlers are eliminated, Owlbear goes berserk (attacks nearest creature, including other enemies)
- Pillars can be used for cover or knocked over (Athletics check) to create difficult terrain

**Crowd Mechanics:**
- Taking down a handler dramatically (Panache kill): +1 Favor
- Surviving an Owlbear hit and staying up: +1 Favor
- Turning the Owlbear against its handlers: +2 Favor to whoever orchestrates it

**Drama Hooks:**
- NPC support character gets grabbed by Owlbear - save them or let them die?
- Handlers offer to call off the beast if the PCs yield (lose all Favor but survive)
- Crowd favorite can spend 3 Favor to have crowd throw a chain to restrain the Owlbear (contested Strength check)

### Option 3: Traitors in the Ranks
**Theme:** Trust, betrayal, and social combat meets physical combat

**Setup:**
The party is paired with 3-4 NPC gladiators for a "team battle" against another group. Midway through, some NPCs reveal they've been bribed/threatened to turn on the party. Classic arena betrayal.

**Initial Enemy Team:**
- 5 Enemy Gladiators (mix of Guard and Thug statblocks)
- 1 Enemy Champion (Veteran statblock, CR 3 - but injured, starts at half HP)

**NPC "Allies" (3-4 total):**
- 2 will betray mid-fight (after round 3 or when Champion drops below 25% HP)
- 1-2 stay loyal (one might be Rohm or another established NPC)

**Combat Flow:**
- Rounds 1-3: Standard team vs team arena battle
- Round 3-4: Betrayal trigger - announcer reveals "plot twist," traitors attack nearest PC
- Rounds 4+: Chaos - some enemies might even attack the traitors, crowd goes wild

**Crowd Mechanics:**
- This is PEAK DRAMA for the crowd
- Surviving betrayal: +2 Favor
- Killing a traitor with Panache: +1 Favor
- Protecting a loyal NPC from betrayer: +1 Favor
- If PCs somehow saw it coming and turn it to their advantage: +3 Favor

**Drama Hooks:**
- One traitor might show reluctance, can be persuaded to switch back (Persuasion DC 15)
- Enemy Champion respects the "honor" and might aid PCs against traitors
- A patron in the stands makes it clear: "Those who survive this with grace will have my support"
- Loyal NPC might die protecting a PC, creating emotional weight

---

### Option 4: The Condemned Sacrifice
**Theme:** Moral choice and asymmetric combat

**Setup:**
The party + NPC allies face a group of condemned prisoners who've been armed and promised freedom if they win. The prisoners aren't warriors - they're desperate people who don't want to die. Some might be families, elderly, or injured. But they've been given numbers and rudimentary weapons.

**Enemies:**
- 8-10 Prisoners (use Commoner statblock with clubs/improvised weapons)
- 2 "Leaders" among the prisoners (Bandits, CR 1/8) - slightly more capable
- 1 Guard overseer with whip who drives them forward from the edge

**Twist:**
- Some prisoners will surrender if given the chance
- Others fight desperately to protect family members in the group
- The crowd's reaction depends on HOW the PCs handle it - mercy or brutality?
- Rohm and the steppes youth are watching from the kennels - this hits close to home

**Crowd Mechanics:**
- This is tricky: Different crowd members want different things
- Brutal efficiency might gain Favor from bloodthirsty nobles
- Showing mercy/sparing lives might gain Favor from common folk
- Creative non-lethal solutions gain Favor from theatrical patrons
- Taking too long or appearing weak loses Favor

**Combat Twist:**
After the prisoners are handled (killed/subdued/surrendered), the REAL fight begins:
- 1 Gladiator Champion (Veteran, CR 3) descends: "Let me show you how it's REALLY done!"
- He's fresh, they're worn down from the first fight
- This is about testing their endurance and decision-making under pressure

**Drama Hooks:**
- One prisoner is someone from a PC's background
- Snak is watching - she'll remember who showed mercy vs. who showed cruelty
- A powerful Senator is in attendance - their opinion matters for future patronage
- The survivors (if any) might become recurring NPCs
