# Ultimate Silkwing

## Description
The Ultimate Silkwing is a fearsome chimeric dragon, born from dark magic that fused multiple dragon essences into one terrifying form. Its body shimmers with iridescent scales that shift between deep purple and electric blue, like silk catching firelight. The creature's right arm blazes with internal fire, glowing orange through the scales, while its left arm pulses with sickly green venom glands visible beneath translucent skin.

Lightning crackles around its maw when it opens to roar, and a massive scorpion tail—scaled and armored—curves over its back, dripping with paralytic toxin. Despite its heavy armaments, the Silkwing moves with unnatural grace, preferring to stay airborne where it can unleash its arsenal from above.

The creature's only weak point is a soft crown-plate atop its skull, normally protected by thick horns. Its eyes, while vulnerable, are alert and quick-moving—only the most skilled warriors can land a called shot.

### Traits

**Aerial Combatant.** The Silkwing has advantage on attack rolls against creatures that are grounded while it is flying.

**Weak Spot.** The Silkwing has a vulnerable crown-plate on top of its head. A creature can target this spot by making a called shot (disadvantage on attack roll, or DC 16 [[panache]] check). Attacks that hit the weak spot deal an extra 2d6 damage and ignore the Silkwing's damage resistances.

**Keen Sight.** The Silkwing has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. Called shots targeting its eyes are made at double disadvantage unless the attacker has advantage from [[panache]].

---

### Actions

**Multiattack.** The Silkwing makes three attacks: one with its fire slam, one with its poison darts, and one with its scorpion tail.

**Fire Slam (Right Arm).** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) fire damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

**Poison Darts (Left Arm).** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, range 30/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 9 (2d6 + 2) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its next turn.

**Scorpion Tail Stab.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Lightning Breath (Recharge 5-6).** The Silkwing exhales lightning in a 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 (10d6) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

---

### Reactions

**Tail Sweep.** When a creature the Silkwing can see moves within 10 feet of it while it is flying, the Silkwing can use its reaction to make one scorpion tail stab attack against that creature.

---

### Bloodied Ability (Triggers at Half HP or Below)

**Tremor-Tantrum (1/Day).** When the Silkwing is reduced to half its hit points or fewer, it can use this ability on its next turn (no action required). The Silkwing lands and stomps the ground with tremendous force, causing an earthquake in a 30-foot radius. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 21 (6d6) bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and has its speed reduced to 0 until the start of the Silkwing's next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and isn't knocked prone. The ground in the area becomes difficult terrain until cleared.

After using Tremor-Tantrum, the Silkwing becomes enraged: its movement speed increases to 50 ft. (fly 100 ft.), and it gains advantage on all attack rolls until the end of the encounter.

---

## Tactics

**Rounds 1-3:** Stay airborne, strafing with poison darts and lightning breath. Use scorpion tail to punish anyone who gets close (Tail Sweep reaction). Focus fire slam on anyone who manages to climb or fly up to engage.

**Bloodied (Round 4+):** Land dramatically, use Tremor-Tantrum to scatter the party. While enraged, aggressively close to melee range, using multiattack every turn. Prioritize squishier targets who failed their saves against paralysis.

**Desperate (Below 30 HP):** Attempt to flee by flying straight up, or crash into arena structures to create hazards. If cornered, focuses all attacks on one PC to eliminate them before dying.

## GM Notes
- **Visibility:** Telegraph lightning breath with crackling energy and crowd warnings ("IT'S CHARGING!")
- **Weak Spot:** Let players discover through Investigation checks (DC 13) or NPC hints from the crowd
- **Tremor-Tantrum:** This is the "phase 2" moment—play it dramatically with announcer commentary and terrain changes
- **Aerial Combat:** Have scaffolding, ballista platforms, or flying mounts available so PCs aren't stuck on the ground
- **Loot:** Silkwing scales (crafting material), venom sac (3 doses of paralytic poison), and one eye-gem worth 250 gp
