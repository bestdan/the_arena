## The Arena
The Arena in front of you is barren. The stands are oddly empty, except for a few dozen people in the most expensive box seats. This was meant to be expensive, what is happening? 


## To the Future

There is just a floating tube like a beakker with a large base. Four blue/white balls are in the narrow part at the top. 

One of them drops, and expands / explodes inside the bottom larger bit. 

As it does, time slows, the birds stop flapping everything stops moving. Then it starts speeding up again, faster and faster. The day goes by quickly, then the night. Then days and nights are flickers and flashes. The stars streak the night sky. The Arena is a blur of activity as years stream past. Finally, it starts to slow, the sun becomes recognizable. 

You see the Arena moving quickly, a battle, then preparation for 2 days, structures being built. A strange blue/white misty sphere starts shrinking inwards, becoming more defined, till its the ball you saw drop before. 

As time returns to a normal pace, you find yourselves in a very different arena. The buildings the stands are all newer, shinier. Small orbs and animals flit around the sky. Now, the northern half of the arena stands are full of spectators. The people in the fancy boxes came with you. The southern half of the arena is empty. 

On the far side of the Arena, you see two figures. The gnome from before, but older now, and with a stone orbiting his head. And next to him, a Knight in full plate armor, lightly holding a longsword. A beaker like the one before on the right, with four balls in it. A metronome ticks away on top. Tick, Tick, Tick. 

The larger knight kneels, putting out his hand. The gnome clasps it in his two smaller hands. and they take a moment. Then the Knight rises, and they both turn to face you. The both bow solemnly. 

You have one round to do whatever buffs/actions you want. 

Roll initiative.  GM does it for all 4 versions.

## To the Past
The ball drops to the center, and once again, time slows, then speeds up. But this time, in reverse. The sun sprints the wrong way backwards through the sky. The arena devolves, less light, less shine. You are sure you go past your origin time, and keep going. 

As the speed of time change slows, you find yourself in a very different arena. One dirtier, with simpler drapes, furnishings etc. Now, the nothern half of the stands are empty. The southern half is full of racuous crowds. 

You see... the same two figures? The Knight is larger now, his longsword seems to be a greatsword that he somehow carries one-handed. He's graceful in full plate, with glowing runes shimmering. He stands in front of a younger gnome, less confident, less bearded. The Knight bows his head solemnly to you, while the gnome watches him, takes a deep breath, and begins a spell.
