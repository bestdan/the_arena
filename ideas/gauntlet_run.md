# Gauntlet Run

- **Party:** 5 Level 2 PCs; supporting NPCs are at risk.
- **Theme:** Speed, endurance, and crowd-pleasing momentum across three zones before a 10-round sand timer expires.

## Setup
Arena floor split into three escalating zones. Faster clears earn more Crowd's Favor; momentum is the show.

## Enemies by Zone
- Zone 1: 4 Goblins with nets and crude weapons (CR 1/4 each).
- Zone 2: 2 Hobgoblins with shields holding a defensive line (CR 1/2 each).
- Zone 3: 1 chained Ogre (CR 2) center-posted + 2 Goblin handlers with whips (CR 1/4 each).

## NPC Support
2-3 fellow gladiators (use Guard statblock) help early; they may flee or fall before the Ogre.

## Crowd Mechanics
- Clear Zone 1 in 3 rounds or less: +1 Favor to all.
- Finish Zone 2 without anyone dropping to 0 HP: +1 Favor to party MVP.
- Kill the Ogre with a declared Panache attack: +2 Favor to attacker.

## Drama Hooks
- Ogre breaks its chain at half HP, becoming mobile and nastier.
- Goblin handlers try to unlock other cages if ignored.
- Crowd throws items (healing potions, weapons, rocks) based on performance.
