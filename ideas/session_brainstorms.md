# Fresh Arena Session Hooks

## 1) Chains and Chandeliers
- **Hook:** The Senate demands spectacle; the announcer promises “a dance of iron and fire” as gladiators soar and swing.
- **Arena Layout:** Circular floor with four suspended iron chandeliers on thick chains. Chain pulleys let anyone climb or shoot them to change height. A brazier ring fills the center with light smoke; falling chandeliers create 10-foot fire bursts and lingering embers (difficult terrain).
- **Encounter (4–6 PCs, mid-tier low level):** 2 Veteran shield-duelists on the floor, 3 Scouts on the catwalks with fire arrows, 1 Mage bound with a detonation collar (scripted to explode a chandelier at 50% HP). **Flex:** Remove 1 Scout and lower duelists to Guards for a 4-PC crew; add 1 Berserker who drops from a chandelier if you have 6 PCs.

## 2) Tidal Sand Pit
- **Hook:** “Will they drown in dust?” The arena master floods the sand with underground sluices, turning the floor into sucking mud.
- **Arena Layout:** Four stone platforms rise from a semi-liquid sand pit. Wooden planks can bridge gaps but collapse after a creature crosses. Perimeter ballistae are chained to winches; bolts can be retrieved and re-aimed by anyone who spends a full action.
- **Encounter (4–6 PCs, mid-tier low level):** 1 Bulette pup leaping between platforms (use Young Bulette or reskinned Ankheg), 4 Hobgoblins with pike-and-hook poles to drag PCs into the mire, 1 Hobgoblin Devastator commanding from a platform. **Flex:** Drop the Devastator and replace with a regular Hobgoblin for 4 PCs; for 6 PCs add 2 Guard statblocks as arena attendants who cut planks mid-fight.

## 3) The Auric Menagerie
- **Hook:** Patron Aurix unveils his “gilded pets” and promises a fortune to anyone who survives their frenzy.
- **Arena Layout:** Gilded cages line the edges; every round an unused cage can be opened as a Free Action by any creature adjacent. Broken cages create jagged cover; spilled gold coins create 10-foot slick patches (Dex save or prone).
- **Encounter (4–6 PCs, mid-tier low level):** Start with 2 Guard Beastkeepers (nets, whips) and 1 Lion. Each new round, a new beast emerges unless stopped: Round 2—1 Giant Hyena; Round 3—1 Manticore; Round 4—1 Gladiator Champion who wants to “reclaim his pets.” **Flex:** Skip Round 4 and downgrade Manticore to a Peryton for 4 PCs; add 1 extra Lion and raise Beastkeepers to Scouts for 6 PCs.

## 4) Blades of the Clockwork Colossus
- **Hook:** The artificer guild sponsors a “precision execution.” A lumbering clockwork statue stalks the sands, its gears feeding the crowd’s countdown.
- **Arena Layout:** Statue in center has three rotating ring-blades (5-foot arcs) that move one zone clockwise each round. Four gear-pillars can be jammed (Athletics/Thieves’ Tools) to slow or redirect movement. Sparks rain when blades strike metal, igniting oil slicks placed near cover.
- **Encounter (4–6 PCs, mid-tier low level):** 1 Shield Guardian or reskinned Helmed Horror as the Colossus, 2 Gnome Artificers (use Mage with lightning flavor) hiding behind gear-pillars, 3 Animated Armors guarding the pillars. **Flex:** Remove 1 Artificer and 1 Animated Armor for 4 PCs; add 2 Flying Swords circling the outer ring for 6 PCs.

## 5) Thunder Above, Blood Below
- **Hook:** Storm priests demand tribute in thunder. The Announcer promises “lightning to anoint the brave.”
- **Arena Layout:** Elevated metal grates (catwalk spokes from a central tower) with open blood-slick sand below. Lightning rods on each spoke charge every other round; anyone on a rod’s 10-foot square saves or takes lightning damage; holding a metal weapon grants advantage on disarm attempts during surges.
- **Encounter (4–6 PCs, mid-tier low level):** 1 Priest of Talos (or reskinned Cult Fanatic with lightning), 4 Reavers (Bandits with lightning damage rider on first hit after a surge), 2 Flying Drakes (use Pteranodon with lightning breath cone once). **Flex:** Remove 1 Drake and 1 Reaver for 4 PCs; add 1 Berserker bodyguard for 6 PCs.

## 6) Grave Dust Pageant
- **Hook:** Necromancers stage a “two-act tragedy”—living challengers first, then the dead rise for an encore.
- **Arena Layout:** Stone tomb markers create partial cover; three bone braziers pulse with necrotic light. Extinguishing a brazier (action) weakens undead (they take +2 damage); leaving them lit empowers necromancer heals. Opening sarcophagi mid-fight can reveal loot or skeletal arms that grapple.
- **Encounter (4–6 PCs, mid-tier low level):** Act I—2 Gladiators (Thugs) and 1 Bone Naga (focus caster). Act II (starts at Naga 0 HP): 6 Skeletons crawl out near PCs and 2 Wights arrive from the gates. **Flex:** Swap Bone Naga for a Ghast and remove 2 Skeletons for 4 PCs; add 2 more Skeletons and a third Thug for 6 PCs.
