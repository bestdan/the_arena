# The Cartographer's Curse

- **Hook:** The arena shifts and changes with every heartbeat. Walls rise, floors sink, pillars rotate. Only one map exists—and it's being drawn in real-time by a mad cartographer in a tower above. Reach the exit before the map completes, or be trapped forever in the labyrinth.
- **Party:** 4-6 PCs, level 4+. Emphasize spatial awareness, adaptability, and racing against time.

## Arena Layout
- **Dynamic Maze** (100x100 feet)—starts as open sand pit; walls rise from the ground every 1-2 rounds.
- Walls are 10-15 feet tall stone/metal barriers (AC 15, 50 HP per 10-foot section).
- **Cartographer's Tower** visible at arena's edge (40 feet tall, windowed chamber at top where a robed figure frantically draws).
- Exit gate starts **sealed**; unlocks when cartographer finishes the map (estimated 12 rounds).
- Terrain changes **dynamically**:
  - Round 1: Open sand.
  - Round 2-3: First walls rise (create 4-5 corridors).
  - Round 4-6: More walls; corridors split, dead-ends form.
  - Round 7-9: Pillars rotate, floors tilt, new passages open/close.
  - Round 10-12: Final configuration locks; exit unseals.

## Core Mechanic: Racing the Map
The cartographer draws the maze in real-time, and **the arena physically manifests what they draw**.

### Map Drawing Progress
- Each round, roll 1d4 to determine how many **new features** the cartographer adds:
  - 1: New wall (blocks a passage).
  - 2: New corridor (opens a path).
  - 3: Rotating pillar (changes connections between corridors).
  - 4: Pit trap (10x10 feet, 20 feet deep, Dex save DC 14 or fall; 2d6 bludgeoning).

### Cartographer Interaction
- PCs can **influence the cartographer** via creative actions:
  - **Shout/Signal:** Persuasion DC 15 to convince cartographer to open a path or close an enemy route.
  - **Ranged Attack:** Damage the cartographer (AC 12, 30 HP; behind arrow slits, three-quarters cover). Slowing their drawing delays map completion (gains PCs 1-2 extra rounds).
  - **Bribe/Distract:** Throw gold or create spectacle (Performance DC 13); cartographer pauses to watch (skips one drawing phase).
  - **Destroy Map:** If a PC reaches the tower and destroys the map (AC 10, 20 HP), maze stops changing but current state locks permanently (no exit unlock unless PCs find alternate escape).

### Escape Objectives
- **Primary:** Reach the exit gate when it unlocks (Round 12 or when cartographer finishes map).
- **Alternate:** Destroy the cartographer or the map to freeze the maze; find alternate exit (hidden door in tower base, Investigation DC 16).
- **Secondary:** Survive with all PCs intact (bonus Favor).

## Enemies (Maze Guardians)
Guardians patrol the maze; they **adapt to the changing terrain** and use it to ambush PCs.

### 4 PCs
- 2 **Maze Minotaurs** (use Minotaur, CR 3; know maze layout instinctively; can charge through walls to create new passages).
- 3 **Stone Sentinels** (reskin Animated Armor, CR 1; patrol corridors; attack PCs who linger in one area too long).

### 5 PCs
- 3 Maze Minotaurs.
- 4 Stone Sentinels.

### 6 PCs
- 3 Maze Minotaurs.
- 5 Stone Sentinels.
- Add 1 **Labyrinth Wraith** (use Wraith, CR 5, reduced HP to 50; phases through walls; drains life from PCs trapped in dead-ends).

### Enemy Tactics
- **Maze Minotaurs** use **Labyrinthine Recall** (know all current passages and shortcuts); charge at PCs, use terrain to corner them.
- **Stone Sentinels** block corridors; **Sentinel Stance** (when blocking a passage, impose disadvantage on attempts to move past them).
- **Labyrinth Wraith** (if present) phases through walls to isolate stragglers; life drain punishes PCs who split from group.

## Tactical Elements
- **Dynamic Terrain:** Walls rise/fall unpredictably; PCs must adapt routes constantly. What was a corridor may become a dead-end next round.
- **Cartographer Manipulation:** PCs can shout requests, attack, or distract cartographer to influence maze changes (risk vs. reward).
- **Wall Destruction:** PCs can break walls to create shortcuts (50 HP per section; loud, attracts guardians).
- **Minotaur Shortcuts:** Minotaurs can charge through walls (create 5-foot-wide breach); PCs can follow or avoid.
- **Tower Climb:** One PC could climb tower (Athletics DC 14, 40 feet, 2 rounds) to reach cartographer directly (risky but game-changing).

## Hazards and Twists
- **Rising Walls:** 1d4 new walls per round (DM places randomly; may split party or trap individuals).
- **Rotating Pillars:** Some pillars rotate 90 degrees (changes corridor connections; PCs on pillar make Dex save DC 12 or fall prone).
- **Pit Traps:** Cartographer draws traps randomly (1d4 per 3 rounds); 10x10 feet, Dex save DC 14 or fall 20 feet (2d6 damage).
- **Dead-End Despair:** PCs trapped in dead-ends for 2+ consecutive rounds gain **Claustrophobia** (disadvantage on attack rolls/saves until they escape).
- **Round 10 Twist:** Cartographer goes mad (crowd pressure); starts drawing *chaos*—walls shift every initiative count 10, pillars spin wildly, floors tilt (all creatures make Dex save DC 12 or slide 10 feet in random direction).

## Crowd Favor Hooks
- Navigate a shifting corridor without getting trapped: +1 [[crowds_favor_mechanic|Favor]].
- Convince cartographer to open a path for the party: +2 Favor for clever roleplay.
- Attack cartographer successfully (deal damage through arrow slits): +1 Favor for boldness.
- Destroy a wall to create shortcut with [[panache_mechanics|Panache]]: +1 Favor.
- Rescue a PC trapped in dead-end before Labyrinth Wraith drains them: +2 Favor.
- Reach exit gate first: +2 Favor for speed.
- Climb tower and destroy the map: +3 Favor for audacity.

## Announcer Beats
- Opening: "The Cartographer's pen moves! The sands obey! Walls rise, paths vanish! **Can they outrun the maze itself?!**"
- First wall rises: "Stone erupts! A corridor appears—no, wait—it SHIFTS! Nothing stays still!"
- PC trapped in dead-end: "Cornered! The walls close in! Will they escape or be swallowed by stone?!"
- Round 10 (chaos mode): "THE CARTOGRAPHER HAS GONE MAD! The maze ROARS! Walls spin! Floors tilt! **Chaos reigns!**"
- Exit unlocks: "The map is COMPLETE! The gate OPENS! Run, gladiators, RUN!"
- Victory: "They conquered the ever-changing labyrinth! Wit over stone! Speed over certainty! Tarsus ROARS!"

## GM Tips
- **Pre-Prep Map Changes:** Plan 10-12 rounds of wall placements in advance (or improvise based on 1d4 roll). Keep it unpredictable but fair.
- **Visual Aid:** Use dynamic VTT tools (Foundry, Owlbear.rodeo) to move walls in real-time. If using physical grid, use removable walls (foam, cardboard).
- **Cartographer RP:** Describe cartographer muttering, scribbling furiously, occasionally cackling. Let PCs interact (shout, signal, attack).
- **Minotaur Momentum:** When Minotaur charges through wall, describe it dramatically—stone cracks, dust flies, new breach appears.
- **Dead-End Punishment:** Track which PCs are trapped; impose Claustrophobia after 2 rounds (creates urgency to escape).
- **Chaos Mode (Round 10):** Make it wild but not TPK; walls shift at initiative 10, pillars rotate randomly, floors tilt slightly. Let PCs adapt.
- **Exit Timing:** If PCs destroy map early, lock exit permanently; they must find alternate escape (hidden door in tower, Investigation DC 16).

## Aftermath Seeds
- **Patron Interest:** Architect guild fascinated by PC's spatial reasoning; offers contract to design fortifications or heist blueprints.
- **Rumor:** Cartographer was forced to draw by shadowy patron; they leave cryptic message in tower for PCs (leads to side quest).
- **Downtime:** PC who reached exit first gains **Maze Runner** (advantage on Survival checks to navigate dungeons/labyrinths for 1 week).
- **Injury:** PC trapped in dead-end for 3+ rounds develops **Claustrophobia** (disadvantage on saves vs. fear in enclosed spaces for 1d4 days).
- **Political:** Cartographer survives (if not killed) and becomes NPC contact—offers map services or intel on arena layouts.
- **Loot:** Cartographer's map (if retrieved) functions as **Living Map** (attune to see layout of any dungeon/labyrinth within 1 mile; updates in real-time; 500 gp value).
