# Auric Menagerie

- **Hook:** Patron Aurix unveils his "gilded pets" and promises riches to survivors.
- **Arena Layout:** Gilded cages ring the edges; any adjacent creature can open an unused cage as a free action each round. Broken cages make jagged cover; spilled gold coins create 10-foot slick patches (Dex save or prone).

## Encounter (4-6 PCs, mid-tier low level)
- Start: 2 Guard Beastkeepers (nets, whips) and 1 Lion.
- Round 2: 1 Giant Hyena enters.
- Round 3: 1 Manticore enters.
- Round 4: 1 Gladiator Champion arrives to "reclaim his pets."
- **Flex:** For 4 PCs, skip Round 4 and downgrade Manticore to a Peryton. For 6 PCs, add 1 extra Lion and upgrade Beastkeepers to Scouts.
