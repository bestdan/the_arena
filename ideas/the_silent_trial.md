# The Silent Trial

## Hook
A magical silence field covers the arena, but it's imperfect—loud sounds still break through. The gladiators must defeat a blind but sound-hunting creature while staying quiet enough to avoid its attention. Every clang of steel, every shouted spell, every dropped shield could be their doom.

## Sound Mechanics

### Noise Levels
Actions generate noise (track on a d20 "Noise Meter"):
- **Silent** (0 noise): Moving carefully, gestures, dropping prone
- **Quiet** (+1 noise): Normal walking, drawing a weapon, whispering
- **Moderate** (+2 noise): Melee attack (miss), opening a door, light armor movement
- **Loud** (+3 noise): Melee attack (hit), spell with verbal component, running
- **Deafening** (+5 noise): Spell with thunder damage, metal shield hitting ground, shout/scream

### The Meter
- Start at 0
- Add noise from all PC actions each round
- **0-5**: The Hunter is unaware of PC locations (attacks randomly)
- **6-10**: The Hunter knows general direction (advantage on locating)
- **11-15**: The Hunter knows exact positions (targets at will)
- **16+**: The Hunter goes into a frenzy (+2 to all attacks, extra attack per round)
- Meter decreases by 3 at the end of each round (sound fades)

## The Hunter
**Blind Burrower** (Umber Hulk stats, CR 5, but blinded and reduced to 80 HP)
- **Blind**: Can't see, relies entirely on tremorsense 60 ft and hearing
- **Tremorsense**: Detects movement on ground within 60 ft (flying/climbing negates)
- **Sound Hunt**: At noise 6+, can pinpoint sound sources for targeting
- **Confusion Gaze**: Replaced with **Sonic Screech**—if it takes 15+ damage in one attack, it screeches (all within 30 ft DC 13 Con save or deafened 1 round, +5 to noise meter)

### Burrower Behavior
- Moves toward loudest noise each round
- If noise is 5 or below, moves randomly or burrows underground (reappears next round randomly)
- If it hits a PC, it grapples and tries to drag underground

## Arena Layout
- 60 x 60 ft cavern-like arena with sandy floor (footprints visible)
- **4 Sound Dampeners** (glowing crystals on pillars)—standing within 10 ft reduces your noise by 1
- **2 Noise Traps** (pressure plates)—stepping on them triggers loud gongs (+5 noise)
- **1 Safe Zone** (raised stone platform, 15 ft diameter)—no tremorsense detection, but no cover
- **Tunnel Entrances** (4 corners)—Burrower can emerge from any

## Secondary Enemies
- **4 Cave Crickets** (Giant Centipede stats, CR 1/4)—make constant low chirping, mask PC sounds (-1 noise per cricket alive)
- Dilemma: killing crickets makes arena quieter but also removes sound cover

## Crowd's Favor Opportunities
- Kill an enemy silently (no noise generated that round): +2 Favor
- Save an ally from Burrower grapple without making loud noise: +2 Favor
- Panache for dramatically silent kill (throat slit gesture to crowd): Panache roll
- Intentionally make noise to draw Burrower away from ally: +1 Favor (sacrifice play)
- Defeat Burrower while noise meter is at 5 or below: +3 Favor (master assassins)

## Scaling
- **3 PCs**: Burrower has 60 HP, 2 Cave Crickets, noise thresholds +2 each
- **5 PCs**: Burrower has 100 HP, 6 Cave Crickets, add 1 additional Noise Trap

## Spell Considerations
- **Verbal Components** = +3 noise (most spells)
- **Silent Spell Metamagic** = no noise (if available)
- **Message cantrip** = tactical advantage, no noise
- **Thunderwave, Shatter** = automatic +5 noise AND damage
- **Silence spell** = creates 0-noise zone (incredibly valuable, but Burrower still has tremorsense)

## Announcer Beats
(Announcer speaks in exaggerated whispers)
- *"Shhhhh... the Silent Trial begins. Every. Sound. MATTERS."*
- When noise spikes: *"Oh NO... they HEARD that. The Hunter TURNS..."*
- Cricket killed: *"One less cricket... one less MASK for their footsteps..."*
- Low-noise kill: *"Like a GHOST! The crowd barely BREATHES!"*
- Frenzy triggered: *"The beast goes MAD! All silence is SHATTERED!"*

## GM Tips
- Use a physical d20 or counter for noise—visible tension builder
- Describe the Burrower's head turning, listening, confused
- Players should whisper at the table for immersion (optional but fun)
- If party is too loud early, have the Burrower burrow and reset tension

## Aftermath Seeds
- Burrower carapace worth 100 gp—soundproofing material for armor
- Sound Dampener crystals can be harvested—1 use: reduce noise on an action by 2
- Party gains reputation as "The Silent Killers"—assassin patrons take interest
- Cave Cricket chitin can make strings for instruments with magical resonance
