# The Stampede Run

- **Hook:** "Outrun the herd or be crushed!" The arena becomes a gauntlet as massive beasts are released from gates, charging in waves across the combat zone. Gladiators must fight their opponents while dodging thundering hooves and gnashing tusks. Stand still, and the stampede flattens you.
- **Party:** 4-6 PCs, level 5+. Tests spatial awareness, timing, and ability to fight while constantly repositioning.

## Arena Layout
- Rectangular arena (150 feet long × 80 feet wide) with dirt floor.
- **Beast Gates:** 6 large gates along both long walls (3 per side), release stampeding animals.
- **Safe Platforms:** 8 raised stone platforms (10-foot square, 5 feet high) scattered across arena—above stampede height.
- **Barricades:** 6 wooden barricades (10 feet long, 5 feet high, AC 15, 30 HP each) provide temporary cover but can be destroyed.
- **Trampling Lanes:** Stampedes run in straight lines from gate to opposite wall (or until redirected).

## Stampede Mechanic
- **Initiative Count 20:** Roll 1d6 to determine which gate opens; stampede charges across arena (80 feet movement).
- **Stampede Types:** Alternate or randomize:
  - **Rhinoceros Herd** (1d4+1 Rhinos): Each creature in 10-foot-wide path makes Dex save DC 15 or take 4d8 bludgeoning and knocked prone.
  - **Bull Rush** (2d4 Bulls): 15-foot-wide path, Dex save DC 13 or take 3d6 bludgeoning and pushed 15 feet.
  - **Elephant Stampede** (1d2 Elephants): 20-foot-wide path, Dex save DC 16 or take 6d10 bludgeoning and knocked prone, stunned until end of next turn.
  - **Boar Swarm** (3d6 Giant Boars): 25-foot-wide path, Dex save DC 12 or take 2d6 piercing and knocked prone.

## Stampede Rules
- **Trampling Path:** GM determines or rolls direction (straight line from gate to opposite wall).
- **Multiple Creatures:** If multiple PCs in path, each saves independently.
- **Barricade Defense:** Creatures behind barricades gain advantage on saves; barricade takes damage if stampede hits (2d10 per animal).
- **Platform Safety:** Creatures on raised platforms are above stampede (immune to trampling).
- **Prone Vulnerability:** Prone creatures auto-fail stampede saves (trampled while down).
- **Redirect Stampede:** Animals can be frightened or damaged to change direction (DC 14 Animal Handling or damage equal to 25% HP causes 30-foot turn).

## Stampede Persistence
- **Ongoing Threat:** Animals don't disappear; they mill around arena after initial charge, creating ongoing hazards.
- **Round 1-3:** 1 stampede per round (manageable).
- **Round 4-6:** 2 stampedes per round from different gates (chaotic).
- **Round 7+:** 3 stampedes per round (arena floods with animals, nearly impossible to avoid).

## Enemies (gladiators and beast-handlers)
- 2 Gladiator Champions (CR 5 each; multiattack, parry reaction, work as team to push PCs into stampede paths).
- 3 Beast Masters (CR 3 each; mounted on Dire Wolves, whips to herd stampedes toward PCs, animal handling expertise).
- 1 Druid Wild-Shaper (CR 5; transforms into animals matching stampedes, uses *speak with animals* to direct beasts).
- 4 Kobold Provocateurs (CR 1/8 each; throw javelins, use pack tactics, intentionally trigger stampedes toward PCs).
- **Flex:** For 4 PCs, remove 1 Beast Master and the Druid. For 6 PCs, add 2 more Gladiator Champions and 1 Owlbear to stampede rotation.

## Enemy Tactics
- **Gladiator Champions:** Shove and grapple PCs into trampling lanes; use parry to survive stampedes themselves.
- **Beast Masters:** Mounted mobility to avoid stampedes; whips to redirect animals toward PCs; stay on platforms between charges.
- **Druid Wild-Shaper:** Becomes rhinoceros/elephant to charge alongside stampedes; *speak with animals* to coordinate timing.
- **Kobold Provocateurs:** Harass from platforms, trigger panic in animals to create additional stampedes.

## Crowd Favor Hooks
- Dodge 3 stampedes in a single round: +2 [[crowds_favor_mechanic|Favor]] for agility.
- Redirect a stampede into enemies using Animal Handling or spell: +2 Favor for turning the tables.
- Defeat enemy while both in stampede path (both taking trampling): +2 Favor for reckless courage.
- Never use a safe platform (fight on ground throughout): +3 Favor for bravery.
- Save ally from stampede by shoving them to safety: +2 Favor for heroic intervention.
- Kill the Druid while in animal form during stampede: +2 Favor for hunting the hunter.
- Surf on stampeding animal's back for 1 round (Acrobatics DC 18): +3 Favor for impossible stunt.

## Hazards and Environment
- **Stampedes:** Constant threat from multiple directions; safe spots shrink each round.
- **Prone Trampling:** Being knocked prone by stampede often means being trampled by next wave (death spiral).
- **Barricade Destruction:** Temporary cover breaks down, eliminating safe zones.
- **Animal Chaos:** Milling animals after stampede create difficult terrain, opportunity attacks when moving through them.
- **Exhaustion from Dodging:** After dodging 10+ stampedes, Constitution save DC 14 or gain 1 level exhaustion from constant adrenaline.

## Announcer Beats
- Opening: "RELEASE THE BEASTS! The stampede comes! Will they dance with death—or be TRAMPLED?!"
- First stampede: "RHINOCEROS CHARGE! The ground shakes! MOVE! MOVE! MOVE!"
- PC trampled: "Caught beneath the hooves! Body broken! Dust rises! Is she alive?!"
- Redirect stampede: "BRILLIANT! He turns the herd! The bulls charge his enemies! GENIUS!"
- Multiple stampedes: "GATES OPEN ON BOTH SIDES! Elephants from the left! Bulls from the right! WHERE CAN THEY GO?!"
- Enemy trampled: "The Gladiator too slow! Rhinoceros THROUGH HIM! Blood and thunder!"
- Victory: "They stand amid the chaos! Beasts calmed! Enemies crushed! The arena trembles at their feet!"

## GM Tips
- Use tokens or lines on map to show stampede paths clearly before they charge.
- Announce which gate opens at initiative count 20 so PCs can react (1 round warning optional for fairness).
- Track number of animals in arena; late-game should feel crowded and chaotic.
- Narrate stampedes viscerally: "The ground shakes," "Thunder of hooves," "Bellowing roars."
- Enemies should actively coordinate—Beast Masters trigger gates, Gladiators shove PCs into paths.
- If PC gets trampled, describe the horror: "Hooves descend," "Weight crushes you into dirt."
- Let creative solutions shine: *speak with animals*, *calm emotions*, *animal friendship*, *wall of stone* to redirect.
- Consider allowing PCs to mount stampeding animals (Acrobatics DC 16, Animal Handling DC 14 to control).

## Aftermath Seeds
- Patron interest: Exotic animal trader impressed by "beast handling"; offers partnership importing dangerous creatures (risky, profitable).
- Rumor: The stampede animals are stolen from noble estates—investigation into arena's suppliers could expose corruption.
- Downtime: Rhinoceros horn can be harvested (sold for 150 gp or crafted into *potion of bull's strength* by alchemist).
- Injury: PC trampled 3+ times develops "Stampede Survivor" trait—advantage on saves vs. being knocked prone, but nightmares of hooves.
- Political: Animal rights activists protest arena's treatment of beasts—sabotage attempts threaten future events.
- Reward: Beast Master's enchanted whip (can be used as *+1 whip* with 15-foot reach, command animals within 30 feet as bonus action 1/day).
