# Chrono-boros

- **Hook:** "PAST AND FUTURE COLLIDE!" The arena shifts between two time periods every 3 rounds—ancient battleground (past) and gleaming temporal sanctum (future). Two enemies locked in a temporal ouroboros: the mighty Temporal Knight travels backward through time to protect the younger, weaker mage in the Past, while the ascended Chrono-Mage in the Future invests in and shields a young, inexperienced knight to protect him in the past. The crowd watches both timelines on arcane displays, placing bets on which era falls first.
- **Party:** 5 PCs, level 5. Tests strategic thinking, temporal coordination, and exploiting asymmetric power dynamics across timelines.

## Opening Presentation
- Before combat, arena chronomancer demonstrates the two timelines:
  - **"Behold the PAST—where the knight dominates the field"** (war-torn battlefield, weapon racks, blood-stained stones)
  - **"And the FUTURE—where the mage has ascended to temporal mastery!"** (pristine sanctum, floating crystals, arcane circles)
- Two arcane hourglasses above arena show which timeline is active (sand flows through active one).
- PCs learn rotation: Future → Past → Future, shifting every 3 rounds.
- **CRITICAL:** "In the Future, the ASCENDED MAGE shields his young, untested knight! In the Past, the mighty KNIGHT protects his younger mage! A perfect ouroboros of temporal guardianship!"


## Timeline Rotation: shifts every 3 rounds

### Temporal Sanctum - The Future (Rounds 1-3, 7-9, 13-15)
The "destination" timeline for the Mage—his power is strongest here.
**"Gleaming arcane chamber where the Mage achieved temporal mastery"**
- **Terrain:** Smooth crystal floors (normal movement, pristine footing).
- **Floating Crystals:** Six levitating temporal crystals orbiting the chamber at 10 feet height (AC 15, 20 HP each—if destroyed, explodes for 2d8 force damage in 10-foot radius, DC 14 Dex save).
- **Arcane Circles:** Three glowing ritual circles etched into floor (15-foot diameter each. Standing in one grants advantage on saves vs. time magic but disadvantage on weapon attacks).
- **Temporal Mirrors:** Four standing mirrors along walls (15 feet tall—can be shattered to create difficult terrain, or used to reflect spell effects with clever positioning).
- **Central Orrery:** Massive clockwork device in center (20 feet across, provides full cover, constantly rotating—can be sabotaged with DC 15 Arcana check to impose disadvantage on mage's concentration checks for 1 minute).


### Ancient Battleground - The Past (Rounds 4-6, 10-12, 16-18)
The "origin" timeline for the Knight—his power is strongest here.
**"War-torn battlefield where the Knight earned his legend"**
- **Terrain:** Blood-stained cobblestones (normal movement), cracked and broken in places (scattered difficult terrain patches).
- **Weapon Racks:** Four old weapon racks at corners (contain rusted longswords, spears—can be grabbed as improvised weapons or toppled for half cover).
- **Ancient Braziers:** Two iron braziers with dying embers (bonus action to stoke—creates 10-foot bright light, can be tipped as action for 2d6 fire damage in 10-foot cone, DC 13 Dex save).
- **Bloodstained Altar:** Central stone altar covered in old battle scars (provides full cover, can be used for Last Stand positioning).


## Temporal Shift Mechanic
- **At the end of Round 3 (and every 3 rounds after):** Reality flickers—time shifts between Past and Future.
- **Warning:** At initiative 12 the round BEFORE shift, hourglass sand accelerates visibly—announcer shouts: "TIME SHIFTS! The [next era] approaches!"
- **Positional Translation:**
  - Weapon rack (Past) ↔ floating crystal (Future) — similar corner positions
  - Bloodstained altar (Past) ↔ central orrery (Future) — both central cover
  - War banner pole (Past) ↔ temporal mirror (Future) — similar wall positions
  - Ancient brazier (Past) ↔ arcane circle (Future) — similar tactical zones
  
## Temporal Ouroboros Mechanic (THE CORE PUZZLE)
**"Two warriors, each strong in their own time, each protecting the other's weakness."**

### How It Works:
- **Two Enemies, Two Timelines:** The Temporal Knight and Chrono-Mage each exist in BOTH timelines, but with vastly different power levels.
- **Separate HP Pools:** Unlike traditional temporal echoes, each version has its own HP pool (Past Knight, Future Knight, Past Mage, Future Mage are four separate entities).
- **Timeline-Locked:** Each version only acts when its timeline is active.
- **Asymmetric Power:**
  - **Past:** Strong Knight (CR 5) + Weak Mage (CR 2 apprentice)
  - **Future:** Weak Knight (CR 2 young squire) + Strong Mage (CR 9 master)
- **Protective Synergy:** The strong version actively defends the weak version in its timeline.

### Strategic Implications:
- **Past Strategy:** Focus fire the weak apprentice mage while bypassing/controlling the strong knight.
- **Future Strategy:** Focus fire the weak young knight while bypassing/controlling the strong mage.
- **Resource Trade-off:** Spending resources to kill a strong defender means fewer resources to kill the weak target before timeline shifts.
- **Timeline Dancing:** PCs must coordinate—some hold off the strong enemy while others burst down the weak enemy.
- **Victory Condition:** Kill BOTH the Apprentice Mage (Past) AND the Young Knight (Future) to break the ouroboros. If either strong version survives, they resurrect their counterpart after combat ends (fight restarts after 1 minute).

### Example Round Flow:
- **Rounds 1-3 (Future):** PCs face Strong Mage + Young Knight. PCs try to kill Young Knight while Strong Mage controls battlefield with magic.
- **Round 3 End:** Timeline shifts. Strong Mage and Young Knight vanish.
- **Rounds 4-6 (Past):** PCs face Strong Knight + Weak Mage. PCs try to kill Weak Mage while Strong Knight protects them aggressively.
- **Round 6 End:** Timeline shifts back to Future.
- **Rounds 7-9 (Future):** If Young Knight still alive, they return with remaining HP. If dead, only Strong Mage appears (fighting to prevent paradox).
- **Goal:** Kill both weak versions before time runs out (or before strong versions resurrect them).

## Lair Actions (Initiative Count 20)

The arena itself is imbued with temporal magic that manifests as environmental effects each round. At **Initiative Count 20** (losing initiative ties), one lair action triggers. The GM chooses which lair action based on the tactical situation and pacing needs.

### Base Lair Actions (Rounds 1-7)

**1. Temporal Fracture (Damage + Positioning)**
- **Effect:** Choose one 20-foot-radius area in the arena. All creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 2d8 force damage and be pushed 10 feet in a random direction (roll d8 for compass direction for each creature).
- **Flavor:** "Time itself FRACTURES! Reality tears at the seams!"
- **Tactical Use:** Can push PCs into environmental hazards (braziers in Past, floating crystals in Future). Disrupts formations and positioning.

**2. Chronal Anchor (Control)**
- **Effect:** Target one creature within 60 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or become "time-locked" until the end of their next turn: speed becomes 0, cannot take reactions, and has disadvantage on attack rolls.
- **Flavor:** "FROZEN in a moment! Time holds them STILL!"
- **Tactical Use:** Lock down high-damage dealers (Barbarian, Rangers with Hunter's Mark) or prevent healing from reaching low-HP allies. Wisdom save targets party's weak saves.

**3. Temporal Rewind - Minor (Healing)**
- **Effect:** Choose one enemy in the current timeline (Knight Prime OR Apprentice in Past; Ascendant OR Young Knight in Future). That enemy regains 2d10 HP.
- **Flavor:** "Wounds UNMAKE themselves! Time flows BACKWARD!"
- **Tactical Use:** Use when weak target drops below 10 HP or strong defender drops below 40 HP. Extends encounter naturally by recovering damage.

**4. Mirror of Ages (Tactical Disruption)**
- **Effect:** Temporal mirrors (Future) or war banners (Past) pulse with energy. All creatures must succeed on a DC 14 Intelligence saving throw or become confused about positions and timing—their next attack roll or skill check has disadvantage, and they cannot benefit from flanking or Help actions until the end of their next turn.
- **Flavor:** "Past and Future BLUR! They see themselves in wrong eras!"
- **Tactical Use:** Disrupts coordinated tactics, prevents advantage-fishing. Intelligence save targets unusual stat.

**5. Accelerate Time (Speed Boost)**
- **Effect:** All enemies in the current timeline gain +10 feet movement speed and can take the Dash action as a bonus action until the start of the next lair action (typically 1 round).
- **Flavor:** "Time SURGES forward! They move like LIGHTNING!"
- **Tactical Use:** Helps weak targets escape focus fire, allows strong defenders to reposition. Increases enemy action economy slightly.

**6. Causality Cascade (Damage + Consequence)**
- **Effect:** All creatures who have dealt damage since the last lair action take 1d8 force damage per attack roll they made that hit (no save). This represents temporal backlash—every action has consequences echoing through time.
- **Flavor:** "Actions echo through TIME! Every strike brings CONSEQUENCES!"
- **Tactical Use:** Punishes high-volume attackers (Rangers with multiattack, Barbarian with Reckless). Rewards single big hits over many small ones. Creates interesting tactical tension.

### Escalated Lair Actions (Round 8+)

If the encounter reaches Round 8 or later, lair actions escalate in power. Use the escalated versions of the above actions:

**1. Temporal Fracture - Escalated**
- Damage increases to **3d8 force**
- Save DC increases to **15**
- Radius increases to **25 feet**

**2. Chronal Anchor - Escalated**
- Targets up to **2 creatures**
- Save DC increases to **15**
- Duration extends to end of target's next **TWO turns**

**3. Temporal Rewind - Major Escalated**
- Healing increases to **3d10+10 HP**
- Can target **BOTH enemies** in current timeline

**4. Mirror of Ages - Escalated**
- Also forces confused creatures to use 10 feet of movement in a random direction (compelled by temporal disorientation)
- Save DC increases to **15**

**5. Accelerate Time - Escalated**
- Also grants enemies **advantage on their next attack roll** made before the next lair action
- Movement bonus increases to **+15 feet**

**6. Causality Cascade - Escalated**
- Damage increases to **1d10 force per attack**
- Also imposes **disadvantage on the creature's next damage roll**

---

  - **Momentary Stasis (Recharge 5-6):** As an action, target creature within 60 feet must make DC 17 Con save or be incapacitated and have speed 0 until end of your next turn.
  - **Arcane Abeyance (1/day):** Can store a spell in a bead and give it to Young Knight to cast (uses *haste* on self at start of combat).
- **Special:** **Temporal Aegis** - When Young Knight is within 30 feet, mage can use a reaction to grant the knight +5 AC against one attack or advantage on a saving throw. **Master's Will** - If Young Knight dies, mage casts *revivify* on him as a reaction (once per combat), using a temporal bead (no components required).
- **Tactics:** Stays behind orrery (full cover), casts *slow* to lockdown melee PCs, uses *haste* on Young Knight, *counterspell* to shut down PC magic, and *Momentary Stasis* on the biggest threat.

- **Tactics:** Enhanced by *haste* from the mage, rushes forward enthusiastically to engage PCs in melee and prevent them from reaching the mage. Fights bravely but lacks the tactical sophistication of his prime self. If mage is threatened, interposes himself loyally but predictably.

---

### Temporal Echoes (Minions, Spawn Round 6)

**Temporal Echo (CR 2 each, 2-3 spawn)**

Displaced versions of the party members themselves, pulled from alternate timelines where they never entered the arena. Spectral, hostile, and deeply unsettling—PCs see their own faces twisted with different experiences, different scars, different choices.

**Stats:**
- **HP:** 27 each (4d8+8)
- **AC:** 14 (temporal distortion makes them slightly harder to hit)
- **Speed:** 30 ft., can move through difficult terrain without penalty (phase through obstacles)
- **Abilities:** STR 12 (+1), DEX 16 (+3), CON 14 (+2), INT 10 (+0), WIS 12 (+1), CHA 8 (-1)
- **Saves:** DEX +5, WIS +3
- **Skills:** Stealth +5, Perception +3
- **Damage Resistances:** Force damage (temporal beings)
- **Condition Immunities:** Charmed, frightened (not fully real)

**Attacks:**
- **Multiattack:** Makes two Echo Strike attacks.
- **Echo Strike:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 1d8+3 force damage. These attacks manifest as ghostly weapons that phase through armor.
- **Temporal Distortion (Recharge 5-6):** The Echo unleashes a 15-foot cone of temporal chaos. Each creature in the cone must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be stunned until the end of the Echo's next turn as overwhelming déjà vu and temporal paradox overwhelms their mind.

**Special Abilities:**
- **Phase Step (Bonus Action):** Teleport up to 15 feet to an unoccupied space within line of sight. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks. The Echo briefly flickers out of existence and reappears.
- **Temporal Mimicry:** When an Echo hits a creature with an attack, it "learns" from that creature's fighting style. The Echo gains a cumulative +1 bonus to hit against that specific creature for the rest of combat (maximum +3). This represents the Echo adapting to its target's patterns.

**Spawn Event (Round 3, Initiative Count 20):**
At Initiative Count 20 of Round 3 (during the Future timeline), the central orrery violently spins and pulses. From its swirling mechanisms, 2-3 Temporal Echoes emerge (use 2 for standard difficulty, 3 if PCs are dominating).

**Announcer:** "From timelines UNMADE, your own ECHOES emerge! The arena summons what you MIGHT have BEEN! Face YOURSELVES!"

**Spawn Positions:** Echoes appear within 10 feet of the orrery (center of Future arena), then immediately use Phase Step on their first turn to reach the backline (Rangers/Cleric).

**Note:** Since spawning happens Round 3 now (not Round 6), Echoes will be present during Round 4-6 Past timeline as well, continuing to harass the party.

**Tactics:**
- **Primary Target:** Backline squishies (Gloomstalker Ranger, Hunter Ranger, Life Cleric). Use Phase Step to bypass Champion Fighter and Berserker Barbarian.
- **Coordination:** Time spawn with Chrono-Mage Ascendant's Slow spell. Ascendant slows frontline, Echoes Phase Step to backline, catching Rangers/Cleric in pincer.
- **Temporal Distortion Priority:** Save Temporal Distortion (Recharge 5-6) for when backline clusters or when Life Cleric attempts big healing spell. Stunning the Cleric prevents healing for 1 full round.
- **Survivability:** With only 27 HP each, Echoes die quickly to focused fire (Ranger Hunter's Mark + 2 attacks = ~25 damage). Echoes know this—use Phase Step aggressively to avoid being pinned down.
- **Temporal Mimicry:** Focus attacks on same target repeatedly to stack +1 bonuses. If fighting a Ranger, after 2-3 hits, Echo has +2 or +3 to hit that specific Ranger.

**Flavor and Roleplay:**
- Describe Echoes as having PCs' faces but "wrong"—different scars, different expressions, different equipment. Maybe one Echo wears merchant's clothes (that timeline's version never became a fighter). Another has ritualistic tattoos (became a cultist instead).
- When Echo attacks: "Your echo strikes with moves YOU know—it mirrors your stance!"
- When Echo uses Phase Step: "It flickers like a bad memory—here, then there!"
- When Echo dies: "The alternate timeline COLLAPSES! That future NEVER was!" (Echo dissolves into temporal particles)
- Optional unsettling detail: Have Echoes "recognize" their originals. An Echo might say in a hollow voice: "I was you... until the arena took everything..."

**Why This Design Works:**
- **Thematic Perfection:** Fighting alternate-timeline versions of themselves in a temporal encounter is peak thematic integration
- **Backline Pressure:** Phase Step forces Rangers/Cleric to reposition, prevents static "stand and shoot" tactics
- **CR 2 Balance:** 27 HP means a focused Ranger (Hunter's Mark + 2 attacks) can drop one in 1-2 rounds—not unkillable, but meaningful threat
- **Round 6 Timing:** Spawns during highest-pressure phase (Future timeline with Ascendant's control magic), forces party to split focus
- **Action Economy Tax:** 2-3 Echoes = 4-6 extra attacks per round against backline, forcing defensive reactions and reducing offensive output

## Enemy Temporal Tactics

### Past Timeline (Strong Knight + Weak Mage)
- **Knight's Defense:** Temporal Knight Prime uses legendary actions to intercept attacks on the Apprentice. Positions himself between PCs and mage.
- **Shield Wall:** Knight uses Shield Bash to push melee PCs away from apprentice, maintaining 10-foot proximity for **Guardian's Oath** bonuses.
- **Apprentice Support:** Mage casts *hold person* on biggest melee threat, then uses *magic missile* from behind knight. Casts *shield* reactively if targeted.
- **Retreat Plan:** If overwhelmed, apprentice uses *misty step* to reposition behind altar (full cover), forcing PCs to expose themselves.
- **Desperation:** If apprentice drops to 0 HP, knight uses **Guardian's Advance** to reach him and stabilize with **Temporal Anchor** (once per combat).

### Future Timeline (Strong Mage + Young Knight)
- **Mage Control:** Chrono-Mage Ascendant opens with *slow* on clustered PCs, then *haste* on Young Knight (bonus action via Arcane Abeyance bead).
- **Orrery Cover:** Mage stays behind orrery (full cover), peeking out only to cast. Uses *counterspell* liberally to shut down PC magic.
- **Momentary Stasis:** Uses this on the most dangerous PC (melee striker or caster) to remove them from combat temporarily.
- **Knight Distraction:** Young Knight, enhanced by *haste*, rushes forward enthusiastically to tie up PCs and prevent them from reaching mage. Fights with determination but predictable tactics (easy to bait or outmaneuver).
- **Temporal Aegis:** Mage uses reaction to grant Young Knight +5 AC when targeted, keeping him alive longer despite his inexperience.
- **Emergency Options:** If Young Knight dies, mage uses **Master's Will** to revive him instantly (once). If PCs close in, uses *dimension door* to teleport across arena.
- **Execution:** Uses *disintegrate* on wounded PCs (especially those bloodied from Past timeline).

- **Trigger (party at 50% HP):** "The heroes BLEED! They STRUGGLE against the ouroboros! Their strength WANES! TARSUS—what say you?! Shall we show MERCY to the brave?!"
- **Crowd votes yes:** "The CROWD has SPOKEN! MERCY is granted! Citizens—throw your healing draughts! Let the heroes CATCH them!"
- **PC retrieves potion from danger:** "They DARE to grab the gift under the enemy's SHADOW! FEARLESS!"
- **PC gives potion to ally:** "SELFLESS! They refuse healing for themselves! The crowd LOVES it!"
- **PC drinks potion while surrounded:** "They drink amidst the STORM! DEFIANT!"

## GM Tips

### Setup and Tracking

**Visual Tracking:**
- Use two mini-maps or VTT layers side-by-side labeled "PAST" and "FUTURE"
- Show both simultaneously so players can see which enemies await them in next timeline
- Place hourglasses above maps to indicate active timeline (or use colored borders)

**HP Tracking (CRITICAL - Four Separate Pools):**
- Temporal Knight Prime (Past) - **112 HP**
- Apprentice Mage (Past) - **35 HP** (boosted for balance)
- Chrono-Mage Ascendant (Future) - **78 HP**
- Young Knight (Future) - **55 HP** (boosted for balance)
- Temporal Echoes (if spawned) - **27 HP each** (2-3 minions)

**Lair Action Tracking:**
- Mark Initiative Count 20 on tracker with "LAIR ACTION"
- Pre-roll or choose lair actions based on tactical situation (see Lair Action Selection Guide above)
- Track which lair actions used to avoid repetition (varies encounter, keeps dynamic)
- Note: Round 3 is special—minions spawn instead of normal lair action

**Timeline Tokens:**
- **Past:** Sepia-toned or weathered tokens (legendary knight in battle-worn plate, young mage in simple apprentice robes)
- **Future:** Bright/crystalline tokens (young squire in shiny chain mail, robed archmage with glowing temporal effects)
- **Echoes:** Ghostly/translucent versions of PC tokens (unsettling mirrors)

### Player Education

**Turn 1 Dialogue (Future):**
- Have Ascendant say: "Hold them, young knight! Fight with the courage you'll one day master!"
- Make it CLEAR that killing the weak versions is the goal

**Turn 1 Dialogue (Past, Round 4):**
- Have Apprentice say: "Master, protect me! I'm not strong enough yet!"

**Temporal Awareness Announcements:**
- At top of each round, announce: "Timeline: FUTURE (or PAST). Strong: Mage/Knight. Weak: Knight/Mage. Shifts in X rounds."
- At Initiative 12 the round before shift: "TIME SHIFTS soon! Sand accelerates in the hourglass!"

**Complexity Management:**
- This is a TACTICAL PUZZLE about protection dynamics
- By round 2, players should understand: "Kill the weak one while dealing with the strong one"
- If players seem confused, have Ascendant taunt: "Foolish! You waste attacks on my prime form! Kill the WEAK if you dare break the cycle!"

### Round-by-Round Pacing Guide (Target: 10-12 Rounds)

**Rounds 1-3 (Future): Establishing Threat + Minions**
- **Active Enemies:** Ascendant (78 HP) + Young Knight (55 HP) + **Echoes spawn Round 3** (2-3 at 27 HP each)
- **Lair Actions:** Chronal Anchor (Round 1), Mirror of Ages (Round 2), **Minion Spawn** (Round 3 instead of lair action)
- **Expected Party Damage:** 40-60 HP (highest pressure phase—Slow spell, Momentary Stasis, minion attacks)
- **Expected Enemy Damage:** Young Knight takes 25-40 HP, Echoes take 10-20 HP total, Ascendant takes 10-20 HP (hard to reach)
- **GM Notes:** This is the HARDEST phase, happening FIRST. Ascendant opens with Slow (DC 17 Wis save, targets 4-5 PCs). Uses Haste on Young Knight (via Arcane Abeyance bead). Echoes spawn Round 3 and Phase Step to backline immediately. PCs learn the hard way that weak targets are priority.
- **Pacing Check:** If PCs are dominating (Young Knight already dead, Echoes killed quickly), have Ascendant use Disintegrate aggressively on biggest threat.

**Rounds 4-6 (Past): Control After Minions**
- **Active Enemies:** Knight Prime (112 HP) + Apprentice (35 HP) + Echoes (if any survived from Future)
- **Lair Actions:** Accelerate Time (Round 4), Temporal Fracture (Round 5), Chronal Anchor (Round 6)
- **Expected Party Damage:** 30-40 HP (Knight's longsword attacks, Apprentice's Magic Missile, plus lingering Echoes)
- **Expected Enemy Damage:** Apprentice takes 15-25 HP, Knight takes 20-30 HP, Echoes mopped up
- **GM Notes:** Party learns puzzle after brutal Future phase. Knight uses Guardian's Oath and legendary actions aggressively. Apprentice stays behind knight, casts Hold Person on Barbarian/Fighter. **Arena's Mercy may trigger here** if party HP drops below 125 from accumulated damage.
- **Pacing Check:** If Apprentice drops below 10 HP by Round 5, consider using Temporal Rewind (heal 2d10) as lair action in Round 6.

**Rounds 7-9 (Future Returns): Escalation Phase**
- **Active Enemies:** Ascendant (remaining HP, likely 40-60) + Young Knight (remaining HP, likely 10-25 if still alive)
- **Lair Actions:** Temporal Rewind Minor (Round 7, heal Young Knight or Ascendant), **Temporal Storm** (Round 8 if both weak targets alive) OR Chronal Anchor Escalated (if one weak target dead), Temporal Fracture Escalated (Round 9)
- **Expected Party Damage:** 35-50 HP (Temporal Storm is brutal if triggered—avg 45 HP to party)
- **Expected Enemy Damage:** Young Knight likely killed this phase (priority target), Ascendant takes 40-60 HP
- **GM Notes:** **CRITICAL PHASE.** If Young Knight still alive at Round 8, Temporal Storm activates—party takes massive damage and learns urgency. If Young Knight dead, only Ascendant remains (fighting to prevent paradox). This is a "do or die" phase for weak targets.
- **Pacing Check:** If both weak targets still alive at Round 8, **must** use Temporal Storm to create urgency. If party struggling badly, Arena's Mercy triggers (if not already used).

**Rounds 10-12 (Past Returns): Endgame**
- **Active Enemies:** Knight Prime (remaining HP, likely 60-80) + Apprentice (remaining HP, likely 0-25)
- **Lair Actions:** Accelerate Time Escalated (Round 10), Temporal Rewind Major Escalated (Round 11, heal both if alive), Causality Cascade Escalated (Round 12)
- **Expected Party Damage:** 20-40 HP (Enraged Knight if Apprentice dead, or desperate defense if alive)
- **Expected Enemy Damage:** Apprentice killed (priority), Knight killed or enters final Rage
- **GM Notes:** If Apprentice already killed in Rounds 4-6, Knight is enraged (advantage on attacks, resistance to all damage). If Apprentice still alive, Knight desperately defends using all legendary actions. Knight's last stand is brutal but beatable.
- **Victory:** Likely by Round 11-12 if PCs played tactically. If combat reaches Round 13+, remaining strong version offers conditional surrender: "You have broken the cycle... I yield." (Partial victory, reduced rewards).

### Environmental Interactions and Persistence

### When Weak Targets Die Early or Late

**Apprentice Dies Rounds 1-3 (Fast Kill):**
- Knight Prime enters RAGE immediately (advantage on attacks, resistance to all damage, loses legendary actions)
- Future timeline (Rounds 4-6) has only Ascendant + Young Knight (easier without Knight Prime backup in Rounds 7-9)
- Past timeline (Rounds 7-9) has enraged Knight alone—dangerous but manageable
- Victory likely by Round 9-10 (shorter encounter)
- Lair actions focus on healing Knight (Temporal Rewind spam) and damage (Temporal Fracture, Causality Cascade)

**Young Knight Dies Rounds 4-6 (Fast Kill):**
- Ascendant uses Master's Will (reaction revive at 1 HP) immediately
- Young Knight revived and Hasted again, fights desperately
- If killed AGAIN, stays dead (no second revive)
- Future timeline (Rounds 10-12) has only Ascendant (pure caster fight)
- Victory likely by Round 10-11 (shorter encounter)
- Lair actions focus on control (Chronal Anchor, Mirror of Ages) and damage (Causality Cascade)

**Both Weak Targets Die Before Round 8 (Optimal Play):**
- NO Temporal Storm (major threat avoided—party did well)
- Encounter ends Round 9-11
- Only strong enemies remain: Knight Prime (enraged) + Ascendant (alone)
- Lair actions defensive (healing, control) rather than punishing
- **Reward:** PCs gain +5 Favor for tactical genius, Arena title "Ouroboros Breakers"

**Both Weak Targets Alive Past Round 8 (Suboptimal Play):**
- Temporal Storm activates Round 8 (and every 2 rounds after: 10, 12, etc.)
- Extended encounter, likely reaches Round 12-14
- High resource drain—Arena's Mercy likely triggered, multiple close calls
- Temporal Storm deals ~45 HP total to party each time (5 PCs × avg 9 HP)
- **Lesson:** Focus weak targets early or suffer consequences


### Balancing on the Fly

**If PCs Struggling (Subtle Helps):**
- Ascendant wastes Disintegrate on high-HP Barbarian (50-70 damage, Barbarian survives)
- Knight uses Temporal Slash (damage) instead of Protective Parry (defense)
- Echoes don't use Phase Step optimally (stay in frontline reach)
- Reduce lair action frequency (skip a round) or use less severe ones (Accelerate Time instead of Temporal Fracture)

**If PCs Steamrolling (Subtle Challenges):**
- Ascendant saves Counterspell specifically for healing spells (denies Life Cleric big heals)
- Knight grapples PCs trying to reach Apprentice (contested Athletics, advantage from Guardian's Oath)
- Echoes coordinate Phase Step timing (all three Phase Step same turn, surround Cleric)
- Use escalated lair actions earlier (Round 7 instead of Round 8)
