# Chrono-boros

- **Hook:** "PAST AND FUTURE COLLIDE!" The arena shifts between two time periods every 3 rounds—ancient battleground (past) and gleaming temporal sanctum (future). Two enemies locked in a temporal ouroboros: the mighty Temporal Knight travels backward through time to protect his younger, weaker mage-self in the Past, while the ascended Chrono-Mage in the Future conjures and shields the weakened knight-self who serves him there. The crowd watches both timelines on arcane displays, placing bets on which era falls first.
- **Party:** 5 PCs, level 5. Tests strategic thinking, temporal coordination, and exploiting asymmetric power dynamics across timelines.

## Opening Presentation
- Before combat, arena chronomancer demonstrates the two timelines:
  - **"Behold the ANCIENT PAST—where the knight's legend was forged 1,000 years ago!"** (war-torn battlefield, weapon racks, blood-stained stones)
  - **"And the DISTANT FUTURE—where the mage ascends to temporal mastery!"** (pristine sanctum, floating crystals, arcane circles)
- Two arcane hourglasses above arena show which timeline is active (sand flows through active one).
- PCs learn rotation: Past → Future → Past, shifting every 3 rounds.
- **CRITICAL:** "In the Past, the mighty KNIGHT protects his younger mage-self! In the Future, the ASCENDED MAGE shields his weakened knight-self! A perfect ouroboros of temporal guardianship!"
- **Puzzle Hint:** "Break the cycle by exploiting the weak when the strong cannot defend them!"

## Timeline Rotation (100-foot square, shifts every 3 rounds)

### Ancient Battleground - The Past (Rounds 1-3, 7-9, 13-15)
**"War-torn battlefield where the Knight earned his legend"**
- **Terrain:** Blood-stained cobblestones (normal movement), cracked and broken in places (scattered difficult terrain patches).
- **Weapon Racks:** Four old weapon racks at corners (contain rusted longswords, spears—can be grabbed as improvised weapons or toppled for half cover).
- **War Banners:** Three tattered banners on 20-foot poles (Athletics DC 12 to climb, can be cut down to create 15-foot-radius obscurement).
- **Ancient Braziers:** Two iron braziers with dying embers (bonus action to stoke—creates 10-foot bright light, can be tipped as action for 2d6 fire damage in 10-foot cone, DC 13 Dex save).
- **Bloodstained Altar:** Central stone altar covered in old battle scars (provides full cover, can be used for Last Stand positioning).
- **Temporal Note:** The "origin" timeline for the Knight—his power is strongest here.

### Temporal Sanctum - The Future (Rounds 4-6, 10-12, 16-18)
**"Gleaming arcane chamber where the Mage achieved temporal mastery"**
- **Terrain:** Smooth crystal floors (normal movement, pristine footing).
- **Floating Crystals:** Six levitating temporal crystals orbiting the chamber at 10 feet height (AC 15, 20 HP each—if destroyed, explodes for 2d8 force damage in 10-foot radius, DC 14 Dex save).
- **Arcane Circles:** Three glowing ritual circles etched into floor (15-foot diameter each—standing in one grants advantage on saves vs. time magic but disadvantage on weapon attacks).
- **Temporal Mirrors:** Four standing mirrors along walls (15 feet tall—can be shattered to create difficult terrain, or used to reflect spell effects with clever positioning).
- **Central Orrery:** Massive clockwork device in center (20 feet across, provides full cover, constantly rotating—can be sabotaged with DC 15 Arcana check to impose disadvantage on mage's concentration checks for 1 minute).
- **Temporal Note:** The "destination" timeline for the Mage—his power is strongest here.

## Temporal Shift Mechanic
- **At Initiative Count 20, end of Round 3 (and every 3 rounds after):** Reality flickers—time shifts between Past and Future.
- **Warning:** At initiative 12 the round BEFORE shift, hourglass sand accelerates visibly—announcer shouts: "TIME SHIFTS! The [next era] approaches!"
- **Positional Translation:**
  - Weapon rack (Past) ↔ floating crystal (Future) — similar corner positions
  - Bloodstained altar (Past) ↔ central orrery (Future) — both central cover
  - War banner pole (Past) ↔ temporal mirror (Future) — similar wall positions
  - Ancient brazier (Past) ↔ arcane circle (Future) — similar tactical zones
  
## Temporal Ouroboros Mechanic (THE CORE PUZZLE)
**"Two warriors, each strong in their own time, each protecting the other's weakness."**

### How It Works:
- **Two Enemies, Two Timelines:** The Temporal Knight and Chrono-Mage each exist in BOTH timelines, but with vastly different power levels.
- **Separate HP Pools:** Unlike traditional temporal echoes, each version has its own HP pool (Past Knight, Future Knight, Past Mage, Future Mage are four separate entities).
- **Timeline-Locked:** Each version only acts when its timeline is active.
- **Asymmetric Power:**
  - **Past:** Strong Knight (CR 5) + Weak Mage (CR 2 apprentice)
  - **Future:** Weak Knight (CR 2 fading echo) + Strong Mage (CR 9 master)
- **Protective Synergy:** The strong version actively defends the weak version in its timeline.

### Strategic Implications:
- **Past Strategy:** Focus fire the weak apprentice mage while bypassing/controlling the strong knight.
- **Future Strategy:** Focus fire the weak fading knight while bypassing/controlling the strong mage.
- **Resource Trade-off:** Spending resources to kill a strong defender means fewer resources to kill the weak target before timeline shifts.
- **Timeline Dancing:** PCs must coordinate—some hold off the strong enemy while others burst down the weak enemy.
- **Victory Condition:** Kill BOTH the Weak Mage (Past) AND the Weak Knight (Future) to break the ouroboros. If either strong version survives, they resurrect their counterpart after combat ends (fight restarts after 1 minute).

### Example Round Flow:
- **Rounds 1-3 (Past):** PCs face Strong Knight + Weak Mage. PCs try to kill Weak Mage while Strong Knight protects them aggressively.
- **Round 3 End:** Timeline shifts. Strong Knight and Weak Mage vanish.
- **Rounds 4-6 (Future):** PCs face Strong Mage + Weak Knight. PCs try to kill Weak Knight while Strong Mage controls battlefield with magic.
- **Round 6 End:** Timeline shifts back to Past.
- **Rounds 7-9 (Past):** If Weak Mage still alive, they return with remaining HP. If dead, only Strong Knight appears (fighting to prevent paradox).
- **Goal:** Kill both weak versions before time runs out (or before strong versions resurrect them).

  - **Momentary Stasis (Recharge 5-6):** As an action, target creature within 60 feet must make DC 17 Con save or be incapacitated and have speed 0 until end of your next turn.
  - **Arcane Abeyance (1/day):** Can store a spell in a bead and give it to Fading Knight to cast (uses *haste* on self at start of combat).
- **Special:** **Temporal Aegis** - When Fading Knight is within 30 feet, mage can use a reaction to grant the knight +5 AC against one attack or advantage on a saving throw. **Master's Will** - If Fading Knight dies, mage casts *revivify* on him as a reaction (once per combat), using a temporal bead (no components required).

- **Tactics:** Enhanced by *haste* from the mage, rushes forward to engage PCs in melee and prevent them from reaching the mage. Uses Temporal Strike to lock down threats. If mage is threatened, interposes himself.

## Enemy Temporal Tactics

### Past Timeline (Strong Knight + Weak Mage)
- **Knight's Defense:** Temporal Knight Prime uses legendary actions to intercept attacks on the Apprentice. Positions himself between PCs and mage.
- **Shield Wall:** Knight uses Shield Bash to push melee PCs away from apprentice, maintaining 10-foot proximity for **Guardian's Oath** bonuses.
- **Apprentice Support:** Mage casts *hold person* on biggest melee threat, then uses *magic missile* from behind knight. Casts *shield* reactively if targeted.
- **Retreat Plan:** If overwhelmed, apprentice uses *misty step* to reposition behind altar (full cover), forcing PCs to expose themselves.
- **Desperation:** If apprentice drops to 0 HP, knight uses **Guardian's Advance** to reach him and stabilize with **Temporal Anchor** (once per combat).

### Future Timeline (Strong Mage + Weak Knight)
- **Mage Control:** Chrono-Mage Ascendant opens with *slow* on clustered PCs, then *haste* on Fading Knight (bonus action via Arcane Abeyance bead).
- **Orrery Cover:** Mage stays behind orrery (full cover), peeking out only to cast. Uses *counterspell* liberally to shut down PC magic.
- **Momentary Stasis:** Uses this on the most dangerous PC (melee striker or caster) to remove them from combat temporarily.
- **Knight Distraction:** Fading Knight, enhanced by *haste*, rushes forward to tie up PCs and prevent them from reaching mage. Uses Temporal Strike to apply slow effect.
- **Temporal Aegis:** Mage uses reaction to grant Fading Knight +5 AC when targeted, keeping him alive longer.
- **Emergency Options:** If Fading Knight dies, mage uses **Master's Will** to revive him instantly (once). If PCs close in, uses *dimension door* to teleport across arena.
- **Execution:** Uses *disintegrate* on wounded PCs (especially those bloodied from Past timeline).

## Announcer Beats
- **Opening:** "THE TEMPORAL OUROBOROS! In the PAST, the legendary knight protects his younger mage! In the FUTURE, the ascended mage shields his fading knight! An ETERNAL cycle of protection! Can they break the LOOP?!"
- **First shift (Past → Future):** "MILLENNIA PASS IN AN INSTANT! The apprentice becomes MASTER! The knight becomes ECHO!"
- **Future → Past:** "TIME REWINDS! The master returns to youth! The echo regains LEGEND!"
- **Apprentice takes damage:** "The young mage BLEEDS! Can the knight save his charge before time shifts?!"
- **Fading Knight takes damage:** "The spectral guardian FLICKERS! Will the master's magic sustain him?!"
- **Apprentice killed:** "THE APPRENTICE FALLS! But wait—the knight SAVES him with temporal stasis! INCREDIBLE!"
- **Apprentice permanently killed:** "THE PAST IS BROKEN! The young mage dies—and the knight enters RAGE! FURIOUS! UNSTOPPABLE!"
- **Fading Knight killed:** "THE ECHO FADES! But the master RESURRECTS him from pure TIME! DEFIANT!"
- **Strong Knight's legendary actions:** "THREE strikes in the blink of an eye! LEGENDARY defense! The apprentice remains UNTOUCHED!"
- **Ascendant Mage's *slow* hits multiple PCs:** "TIME ITSELF TURNS AGAINST THEM! They move like statues in TAR!"
- **Ascendant uses *Momentary Stasis*:** "FROZEN! A moment stretched to ETERNITY! They can only WATCH!"
- **PC destroys floating crystals:** "SHATTERED! The temporal crystals EXPLODE! BRILLIANT!"
- **Orrery sabotaged:** "The clockwork BREAKS! The master's magic WAVERS!"
- **First weak version killed:** "ONE link in the chain BREAKS! But the ouroboros holds—barely!"
- **Both weak versions killed:** "THE CYCLE IS BROKEN! Past and future COLLAPSE! The ouroboros DIES! They've conquered TIME ITSELF!"

## GM Tips
- **Visual Tracking:** Use two mini-maps or VTT layers side-by-side labeled "PAST" and "FUTURE." Show both simultaneously so players can see which enemies await them.
- **HP Tracking:** Keep FOUR separate HP trackers:
  - Temporal Knight Prime (Past) - 112 HP
  - Apprentice Mage (Past) - 22 HP
  - Chrono-Mage Ascendant (Future) - 78 HP
  - Fading Knight (Future) - 38 HP
- **Timeline Tokens:** Use different visual styles:
  - **Past:** Sepia-toned or weathered tokens (rusted knight, young mage in simple robes)
  - **Future:** Bright/crystalline tokens (spectral translucent knight, robed archmage with glowing effects)
- **Player Education:**
  - First round (Past), have Apprentice say: "Master, protect me! I'm not strong enough yet!"
  - First round (Future), have Ascendant say: "Hold them, my echo! You were once mighty!"
  - Make it CLEAR that killing the weak versions is the goal, not the strong versions.
- **Temporal Awareness:** Announce at top of each round: "Timeline: PAST (or FUTURE). Strong: Knight/Mage. Weak: Mage/Knight. Shifts in X rounds."
- **Complexity Management:** This is a TACTICAL PUZZLE about protection dynamics. Players should quickly understand: "Kill the weak one while dealing with the strong one."
- **Pacing:**
  - 3-round timeline windows give PCs time to make meaningful progress before shift.
  - Warning at initiative 12 the round before shift lets PCs plan ("Should we nova the apprentice NOW before timeline shifts?").
  - If combat drags past Round 12, have strong versions offer surrender (conditional victory) to maintain pace.
- **Environmental Interactions:** Track environmental changes:
  - Tipped brazier in Past remains tipped when Past returns (scorch marks remain).
  - Destroyed floating crystals in Future remain destroyed (debris remains).
  - Sabotaged orrery stays sabotaged (continues imposing concentration disadvantage).
- **Balancing:** If PCs struggle, have enemies make tactical mistakes (Ascendant wastes *disintegrate* on high-HP tank, Knight uses Temporal Slash when should use Protective Parry). If PCs steamroll, have enemies play optimally (Ascendant saves *counterspell* for healing spells, Knight grapples PCs trying to reach apprentice).

## Aftermath Seeds
- **Temporal Scars:** PCs who survived both timelines gain "Chrono-Touched" trait—occasionally experience moments in "wrong" order (déjà vu or premonition). DM gives cryptic hints about future events 1/session.
- **Patron Interest:** A temporal scholar impressed by PCs' ability to "break an ouroboros" offers contract to investigate temporal anomaly—well-paid but dangerous time magic research.
- **Rumor:** Breaking the temporal loop caused ripples—some Tarsus citizens report seeing "ghost" versions of themselves from slightly different timelines (their past or future selves bleeding through).
- **Downtime:** Chrono-Mage Ascendant's spellbook can be claimed—contains *slow*, *haste*, and two Chronurgy spells (*gift of alacrity*, *fortune's favor*). Wizard PCs can copy them. Also contains research notes on "temporal immortality through self-protection paradox."
- **Injury:** PC who was hit by *Momentary Stasis* or *slow* repeatedly develops "Temporal Lag"—1/day, DM can declare they act last in initiative order that round (as if stuck in slow time). Cosmetic curse, unsettling.
- **Legendary Moment:** If PCs killed BOTH weak versions before Round 10 (fast victory), gain Arena title: "Ouroboros Breakers." Time mages across Tarsus hear the name. +2 [[crowds_favor|Favor]] to starting Favor in future fights.
- **Political:** Arena's use of "self-sustaining temporal loop" may violate Tarsus's chronomancy laws (forbidden after "The Unraveling" 200 years ago). Imperial magistrates investigate. Arena master needs PCs to testify that fight was "theatrical illusion, not true time magic" (perjury).
- **Loot Options:**
  - **Temporal Knight's Longsword (Past version):** +1 longsword that deals extra 1d6 force damage. Once per day, after making an attack roll, can "rewind" and reroll, taking better result.
  - **Apprentice's Temporal Focus (amulet):** Grants bearer ability to cast *shield* 3/day (no spell slot required). Bearer ages 1 day per use (cosmetic, no mechanical effect unless extreme overuse over months).
  - **Chrono-Mage's Temporal Robes:** Grants advantage on saves vs. time magic. Once per day, when hit by an attack, can use reaction to "phase" briefly—attacker rerolls with disadvantage.
  - **Fading Knight's Spectral Plate (armor):** Medium armor, AC 15 + Dex (max +2). Wearer gains resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning/piercing/slashing damage but is translucent (disadvantage on Stealth in bright light due to shimmer).
- **Quirk:** Temporal Knight Prime's longsword sometimes "remembers" enemies it killed in past timelines—when drawn near undead or constructs, blade hums and deals +1d4 radiant damage to those creature types (echoes of past battles).
