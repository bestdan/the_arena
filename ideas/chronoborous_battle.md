# Chrono-boros

- **Hook:** "PAST AND FUTURE COLLIDE!" The arena shifts between two time periods every 3 rounds—ancient battleground (past) and gleaming temporal sanctum (future). Two enemies locked in a temporal ouroboros: the mighty Temporal Knight travels backward through time to protect his younger, weaker mage-self in the Past, while the ascended Chrono-Mage in the Future creates and shields a young, inexperienced knight-self who serves him there. The crowd watches both timelines on arcane displays, placing bets on which era falls first.
- **Party:** 5 PCs, level 5. Tests strategic thinking, temporal coordination, and exploiting asymmetric power dynamics across timelines.

## Opening Presentation
- Before combat, arena chronomancer demonstrates the two timelines:
  - **"Behold the ANCIENT PAST—where the knight's legend was forged 1,000 years ago!"** (war-torn battlefield, weapon racks, blood-stained stones)
  - **"And the DISTANT FUTURE—where the mage ascends to temporal mastery!"** (pristine sanctum, floating crystals, arcane circles)
- Two arcane hourglasses above arena show which timeline is active (sand flows through active one).
- PCs learn rotation: Future → Past → Future, shifting every 3 rounds.
- **CRITICAL:** "In the Future, the ASCENDED MAGE shields his young, untested knight-self! In the Past, the mighty KNIGHT protects his younger mage-self! A perfect ouroboros of temporal guardianship!"
- **Puzzle Hint:** "Break the cycle by exploiting the weak when the strong cannot defend them!"

## Timeline Rotation (100-foot square, shifts every 3 rounds)

### Temporal Sanctum - The Future (Rounds 1-3, 7-9, 13-15)
**"War-torn battlefield where the Knight earned his legend"**
- **Terrain:** Blood-stained cobblestones (normal movement), cracked and broken in places (scattered difficult terrain patches).
- **Weapon Racks:** Four old weapon racks at corners (contain rusted longswords, spears—can be grabbed as improvised weapons or toppled for half cover).
- **War Banners:** Three tattered banners on 20-foot poles (Athletics DC 12 to climb, can be cut down to create 15-foot-radius obscurement).
- **Ancient Braziers:** Two iron braziers with dying embers (bonus action to stoke—creates 10-foot bright light, can be tipped as action for 2d6 fire damage in 10-foot cone, DC 13 Dex save).
- **Bloodstained Altar:** Central stone altar covered in old battle scars (provides full cover, can be used for Last Stand positioning).
- **Temporal Note:** The "origin" timeline for the Knight—his power is strongest here.

### Ancient Battleground - The Past (Rounds 4-6, 10-12, 16-18)
**"Gleaming arcane chamber where the Mage achieved temporal mastery"**
- **Terrain:** Smooth crystal floors (normal movement, pristine footing).
- **Floating Crystals:** Six levitating temporal crystals orbiting the chamber at 10 feet height (AC 15, 20 HP each—if destroyed, explodes for 2d8 force damage in 10-foot radius, DC 14 Dex save).
- **Arcane Circles:** Three glowing ritual circles etched into floor (15-foot diameter each—standing in one grants advantage on saves vs. time magic but disadvantage on weapon attacks).
- **Temporal Mirrors:** Four standing mirrors along walls (15 feet tall—can be shattered to create difficult terrain, or used to reflect spell effects with clever positioning).
- **Central Orrery:** Massive clockwork device in center (20 feet across, provides full cover, constantly rotating—can be sabotaged with DC 15 Arcana check to impose disadvantage on mage's concentration checks for 1 minute).
- **Temporal Note:** The "destination" timeline for the Mage—his power is strongest here.

## Temporal Shift Mechanic
- **At Initiative Count 20, end of Round 3 (and every 3 rounds after):** Reality flickers—time shifts between Past and Future.
- **Warning:** At initiative 12 the round BEFORE shift, hourglass sand accelerates visibly—announcer shouts: "TIME SHIFTS! The [next era] approaches!"
- **Positional Translation:**
  - Weapon rack (Past) ↔ floating crystal (Future) — similar corner positions
  - Bloodstained altar (Past) ↔ central orrery (Future) — both central cover
  - War banner pole (Past) ↔ temporal mirror (Future) — similar wall positions
  - Ancient brazier (Past) ↔ arcane circle (Future) — similar tactical zones
  
## Temporal Ouroboros Mechanic (THE CORE PUZZLE)
**"Two warriors, each strong in their own time, each protecting the other's weakness."**

### How It Works:
- **Two Enemies, Two Timelines:** The Temporal Knight and Chrono-Mage each exist in BOTH timelines, but with vastly different power levels.
- **Separate HP Pools:** Unlike traditional temporal echoes, each version has its own HP pool (Past Knight, Future Knight, Past Mage, Future Mage are four separate entities).
- **Timeline-Locked:** Each version only acts when its timeline is active.
- **Asymmetric Power:**
  - **Past:** Strong Knight (CR 5) + Weak Mage (CR 2 apprentice)
  - **Future:** Weak Knight (CR 2 young squire) + Strong Mage (CR 9 master)
- **Protective Synergy:** The strong version actively defends the weak version in its timeline.

### Strategic Implications:
- **Past Strategy:** Focus fire the weak apprentice mage while bypassing/controlling the strong knight.
- **Future Strategy:** Focus fire the weak young knight while bypassing/controlling the strong mage.
- **Resource Trade-off:** Spending resources to kill a strong defender means fewer resources to kill the weak target before timeline shifts.
- **Timeline Dancing:** PCs must coordinate—some hold off the strong enemy while others burst down the weak enemy.
- **Victory Condition:** Kill BOTH the Apprentice Mage (Past) AND the Young Knight (Future) to break the ouroboros. If either strong version survives, they resurrect their counterpart after combat ends (fight restarts after 1 minute).

### Example Round Flow:
- **Rounds 1-3 (Future):** PCs face Strong Mage + Young Knight. PCs try to kill Young Knight while Strong Mage controls battlefield with magic.
- **Round 3 End:** Timeline shifts. Strong Mage and Young Knight vanish.
- **Rounds 4-6 (Past):** PCs face Strong Knight + Weak Mage. PCs try to kill Weak Mage while Strong Knight protects them aggressively.
- **Round 6 End:** Timeline shifts back to Future.
- **Rounds 7-9 (Future):** If Young Knight still alive, they return with remaining HP. If dead, only Strong Mage appears (fighting to prevent paradox).
- **Goal:** Kill both weak versions before time runs out (or before strong versions resurrect them).

## Lair Actions (Initiative Count 20)

The arena itself is imbued with temporal magic that manifests as environmental effects each round. At **Initiative Count 20** (losing initiative ties), one lair action triggers. The GM chooses which lair action based on the tactical situation and pacing needs.

### Base Lair Actions (Rounds 1-7)

**1. Temporal Fracture (Damage + Positioning)**
- **Effect:** Choose one 20-foot-radius area in the arena. All creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 2d8 force damage and be pushed 10 feet in a random direction (roll d8 for compass direction for each creature).
- **Flavor:** "Time itself FRACTURES! Reality tears at the seams!"
- **Tactical Use:** Can push PCs into environmental hazards (braziers in Past, floating crystals in Future). Disrupts formations and positioning.

**2. Chronal Anchor (Control)**
- **Effect:** Target one creature within 60 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or become "time-locked" until the end of their next turn: speed becomes 0, cannot take reactions, and has disadvantage on attack rolls.
- **Flavor:** "FROZEN in a moment! Time holds them STILL!"
- **Tactical Use:** Lock down high-damage dealers (Barbarian, Rangers with Hunter's Mark) or prevent healing from reaching low-HP allies. Wisdom save targets party's weak saves.

**3. Temporal Rewind - Minor (Healing)**
- **Effect:** Choose one enemy in the current timeline (Knight Prime OR Apprentice in Past; Ascendant OR Young Knight in Future). That enemy regains 2d10 HP.
- **Flavor:** "Wounds UNMAKE themselves! Time flows BACKWARD!"
- **Tactical Use:** Use when weak target drops below 10 HP or strong defender drops below 40 HP. Extends encounter naturally by recovering damage.

**4. Mirror of Ages (Tactical Disruption)**
- **Effect:** Temporal mirrors (Future) or war banners (Past) pulse with energy. All creatures must succeed on a DC 14 Intelligence saving throw or become confused about positions and timing—their next attack roll or skill check has disadvantage, and they cannot benefit from flanking or Help actions until the end of their next turn.
- **Flavor:** "Past and Future BLUR! They see themselves in wrong eras!"
- **Tactical Use:** Disrupts coordinated tactics, prevents advantage-fishing. Intelligence save targets unusual stat.

**5. Accelerate Time (Speed Boost)**
- **Effect:** All enemies in the current timeline gain +10 feet movement speed and can take the Dash action as a bonus action until the start of the next lair action (typically 1 round).
- **Flavor:** "Time SURGES forward! They move like LIGHTNING!"
- **Tactical Use:** Helps weak targets escape focus fire, allows strong defenders to reposition. Increases enemy action economy slightly.

**6. Causality Cascade (Damage + Consequence)**
- **Effect:** All creatures who have dealt damage since the last lair action take 1d8 force damage per attack roll they made that hit (no save). This represents temporal backlash—every action has consequences echoing through time.
- **Flavor:** "Actions echo through TIME! Every strike brings CONSEQUENCES!"
- **Tactical Use:** Punishes high-volume attackers (Rangers with multiattack, Barbarian with Reckless). Rewards single big hits over many small ones. Creates interesting tactical tension.

---

### Escalated Lair Actions (Round 8+)

If the encounter reaches Round 8 or later, lair actions escalate in power. Use the escalated versions of the above actions:

**1. Temporal Fracture - Escalated**
- Damage increases to **3d8 force**
- Save DC increases to **15**
- Radius increases to **25 feet**

**2. Chronal Anchor - Escalated**
- Targets up to **2 creatures**
- Save DC increases to **15**
- Duration extends to end of target's next **TWO turns**

**3. Temporal Rewind - Major Escalated**
- Healing increases to **3d10+10 HP**
- Can target **BOTH enemies** in current timeline

**4. Mirror of Ages - Escalated**
- Also forces confused creatures to use 10 feet of movement in a random direction (compelled by temporal disorientation)
- Save DC increases to **15**

**5. Accelerate Time - Escalated**
- Also grants enemies **advantage on their next attack roll** made before the next lair action
- Movement bonus increases to **+15 feet**

**6. Causality Cascade - Escalated**
- Damage increases to **1d10 force per attack**
- Also imposes **disadvantage on the creature's next damage roll**

---

### Temporal Storm (Major Escalation, Round 8+ Only)

**Trigger Condition:** If BOTH weak targets (Apprentice Mage AND Young Knight) are still alive at the start of Round 8 or later, the temporal loop becomes dangerously unstable.

**Effect:** The Temporal Storm replaces the normal lair action. The entire arena becomes temporally chaotic. Every creature in the arena (including enemies) must roll a d20:
- **1-7:** Caught in temporal vortex—take **3d10 force damage** (no save)
- **8-14:** Moving through thick time—speed reduced by **10 feet** until the end of their next turn
- **15-20:** Riding the temporal wave—gain **advantage on next attack roll or saving throw** (creature's choice)

**Flavor:** "The ouroboros grows UNSTABLE! Past and future COLLIDE catastrophically! Time itself TEARS at reality! The loop cannot hold!"

**Frequency:** Can occur once every 2 rounds (Rounds 8, 10, 12, etc.) while both weak targets remain alive.

**Warning (Round 7, Initiative 12):** "The temporal loop STRAINS! If the weak survive much longer, the STORM will come!"

**Tactical Purpose:** Heavily punishes the party for not focusing weak targets. Creates dramatic urgency. Average party damage: ~45 HP total if all roll poorly (5 × 3d10 avg 16.5). This is a significant pressure spike designed to force tactical adjustment.

- **Tactics:** Stays behind the knight, casts *hold person* on melee threats, uses *magic missile* to chip away at PCs, casts *shield* reactively. Uses *misty step* to maintain distance if cornered.

---

  - **Momentary Stasis (Recharge 5-6):** As an action, target creature within 60 feet must make DC 17 Con save or be incapacitated and have speed 0 until end of your next turn.
  - **Arcane Abeyance (1/day):** Can store a spell in a bead and give it to Young Knight to cast (uses *haste* on self at start of combat).
- **Special:** **Temporal Aegis** - When Young Knight is within 30 feet, mage can use a reaction to grant the knight +5 AC against one attack or advantage on a saving throw. **Master's Will** - If Young Knight dies, mage casts *revivify* on him as a reaction (once per combat), using a temporal bead (no components required).
- **Tactics:** Stays behind orrery (full cover), casts *slow* to lockdown melee PCs, uses *haste* on Young Knight, *counterspell* to shut down PC magic, and *Momentary Stasis* on the biggest threat.

- **Special:** **Novice's Determination** - When reduced to 0 HP, can make a DC 12 Constitution save to drop to 1 HP instead (once per combat—sheer willpower). **Bound to the Mage** - While within 30 feet of Chrono-Mage Ascendant and under *haste*, gains +2 AC, +1 to attacks, and +10 movement (magical enhancement).
- **Tactics:** Enhanced by *haste* from the mage, rushes forward enthusiastically to engage PCs in melee and prevent them from reaching the mage. Fights bravely but lacks the tactical sophistication of his prime self. If mage is threatened, interposes himself loyally but predictably.

---

### Temporal Echoes (Minions, Spawn Round 6)

**Temporal Echo (CR 2 each, 2-3 spawn)**

Displaced versions of the party members themselves, pulled from alternate timelines where they never entered the arena. Spectral, hostile, and deeply unsettling—PCs see their own faces twisted with different experiences, different scars, different choices.

**Stats:**
- **HP:** 27 each (4d8+8)
- **AC:** 14 (temporal distortion makes them slightly harder to hit)
- **Speed:** 30 ft., can move through difficult terrain without penalty (phase through obstacles)
- **Abilities:** STR 12 (+1), DEX 16 (+3), CON 14 (+2), INT 10 (+0), WIS 12 (+1), CHA 8 (-1)
- **Saves:** DEX +5, WIS +3
- **Skills:** Stealth +5, Perception +3
- **Damage Resistances:** Force damage (temporal beings)
- **Condition Immunities:** Charmed, frightened (not fully real)

**Attacks:**
- **Multiattack:** Makes two Echo Strike attacks.
- **Echo Strike:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 1d8+3 force damage. These attacks manifest as ghostly weapons that phase through armor.
- **Temporal Distortion (Recharge 5-6):** The Echo unleashes a 15-foot cone of temporal chaos. Each creature in the cone must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be stunned until the end of the Echo's next turn as overwhelming déjà vu and temporal paradox overwhelms their mind.

**Special Abilities:**
- **Phase Step (Bonus Action):** Teleport up to 15 feet to an unoccupied space within line of sight. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks. The Echo briefly flickers out of existence and reappears.
- **Temporal Mimicry:** When an Echo hits a creature with an attack, it "learns" from that creature's fighting style. The Echo gains a cumulative +1 bonus to hit against that specific creature for the rest of combat (maximum +3). This represents the Echo adapting to its target's patterns.

**Spawn Event (Round 3, Initiative Count 20):**
At Initiative Count 20 of Round 3 (during the Future timeline), the central orrery violently spins and pulses. From its swirling mechanisms, 2-3 Temporal Echoes emerge (use 2 for standard difficulty, 3 if PCs are dominating).

**Announcer:** "From timelines UNMADE, your own ECHOES emerge! The arena summons what you MIGHT have BEEN! Face YOURSELVES!"

**Spawn Positions:** Echoes appear within 10 feet of the orrery (center of Future arena), then immediately use Phase Step on their first turn to reach the backline (Rangers/Cleric).

**Note:** Since spawning happens Round 3 now (not Round 6), Echoes will be present during Round 4-6 Past timeline as well, continuing to harass the party.

**Tactics:**
- **Primary Target:** Backline squishies (Gloomstalker Ranger, Hunter Ranger, Life Cleric). Use Phase Step to bypass Champion Fighter and Berserker Barbarian.
- **Coordination:** Time spawn with Chrono-Mage Ascendant's Slow spell. Ascendant slows frontline, Echoes Phase Step to backline, catching Rangers/Cleric in pincer.
- **Temporal Distortion Priority:** Save Temporal Distortion (Recharge 5-6) for when backline clusters or when Life Cleric attempts big healing spell. Stunning the Cleric prevents healing for 1 full round.
- **Survivability:** With only 27 HP each, Echoes die quickly to focused fire (Ranger Hunter's Mark + 2 attacks = ~25 damage). Echoes know this—use Phase Step aggressively to avoid being pinned down.
- **Temporal Mimicry:** Focus attacks on same target repeatedly to stack +1 bonuses. If fighting a Ranger, after 2-3 hits, Echo has +2 or +3 to hit that specific Ranger.

**Flavor and Roleplay:**
- Describe Echoes as having PCs' faces but "wrong"—different scars, different expressions, different equipment. Maybe one Echo wears merchant's clothes (that timeline's version never became a fighter). Another has ritualistic tattoos (became a cultist instead).
- When Echo attacks: "Your echo strikes with moves YOU know—it mirrors your stance!"
- When Echo uses Phase Step: "It flickers like a bad memory—here, then there!"
- When Echo dies: "The alternate timeline COLLAPSES! That future NEVER was!" (Echo dissolves into temporal particles)
- Optional unsettling detail: Have Echoes "recognize" their originals. An Echo might say in a hollow voice: "I was you... until the arena took everything..."

**Why This Design Works:**
- **Thematic Perfection:** Fighting alternate-timeline versions of themselves in a temporal encounter is peak thematic integration
- **Backline Pressure:** Phase Step forces Rangers/Cleric to reposition, prevents static "stand and shoot" tactics
- **CR 2 Balance:** 27 HP means a focused Ranger (Hunter's Mark + 2 attacks) can drop one in 1-2 rounds—not unkillable, but meaningful threat
- **Round 6 Timing:** Spawns during highest-pressure phase (Future timeline with Ascendant's control magic), forces party to split focus
- **Action Economy Tax:** 2-3 Echoes = 4-6 extra attacks per round against backline, forcing defensive reactions and reducing offensive output

## Enemy Temporal Tactics

### Past Timeline (Strong Knight + Weak Mage)
- **Knight's Defense:** Temporal Knight Prime uses legendary actions to intercept attacks on the Apprentice. Positions himself between PCs and mage.
- **Shield Wall:** Knight uses Shield Bash to push melee PCs away from apprentice, maintaining 10-foot proximity for **Guardian's Oath** bonuses.
- **Apprentice Support:** Mage casts *hold person* on biggest melee threat, then uses *magic missile* from behind knight. Casts *shield* reactively if targeted.
- **Retreat Plan:** If overwhelmed, apprentice uses *misty step* to reposition behind altar (full cover), forcing PCs to expose themselves.
- **Desperation:** If apprentice drops to 0 HP, knight uses **Guardian's Advance** to reach him and stabilize with **Temporal Anchor** (once per combat).

### Future Timeline (Strong Mage + Young Knight)
- **Mage Control:** Chrono-Mage Ascendant opens with *slow* on clustered PCs, then *haste* on Young Knight (bonus action via Arcane Abeyance bead).
- **Orrery Cover:** Mage stays behind orrery (full cover), peeking out only to cast. Uses *counterspell* liberally to shut down PC magic.
- **Momentary Stasis:** Uses this on the most dangerous PC (melee striker or caster) to remove them from combat temporarily.
- **Knight Distraction:** Young Knight, enhanced by *haste*, rushes forward enthusiastically to tie up PCs and prevent them from reaching mage. Fights with determination but predictable tactics (easy to bait or outmaneuver).
- **Temporal Aegis:** Mage uses reaction to grant Young Knight +5 AC when targeted, keeping him alive longer despite his inexperience.
- **Emergency Options:** If Young Knight dies, mage uses **Master's Will** to revive him instantly (once). If PCs close in, uses *dimension door* to teleport across arena.
- **Execution:** Uses *disintegrate* on wounded PCs (especially those bloodied from Past timeline).

## Arena's Mercy (Crowd Healing Mechanic)

The crowd's bloodlust has limits—they came for drama and spectacle, not a one-sided massacre. When the heroes bleed too heavily, the citizens of Tarsus may intervene.

### Trigger Condition
- **Check at the end of each round:** If the party's total HP drops to or below 125 HP (approximately 50% of their ~250 HP pool), the Arena's Mercy may trigger.
- **Frequency:** Can only occur **once per combat**.
- **Already Triggered:** If Arena's Mercy has already occurred this combat, this mechanic is exhausted.

### The Crowd's Intervention

**Announcer's Call (Dramatic Pause):**
> "The heroes BLEED! They STRUGGLE against the ouroboros! Their strength WANES!"
>
> "TARSUS—what say you?! Shall we show MERCY to the brave?!"

**Crowd Response (90% chance they vote yes):**
The crowd roars approval—they want a *competitive* fight, not an execution. The announcer grins and gestures dramatically.

> "The CROWD has SPOKEN! MERCY is granted! Citizens—throw your healing draughts to the arena floor! Let the heroes CATCH them!"

### Mechanical Effect

**1d4 Healing Potions** (roll to determine how many, 1-4 potions) land in the arena at various locations.

**Potion Properties:**
- Each potion restores **2d4+2 HP** when consumed (average 7 HP, range 4-10 HP)
- **To Drink:** Bonus action (standard potion rules)
- **To Retrieve:** If not in your square, costs 5 feet of movement as part of your move (free object interaction to pick up)

**Total Healing Potential:** 1d4 potions × 7 HP average = approximately 21-28 HP total healing across the party (7 HP if 1 potion, 28 HP if 4 potions).

### Landing Locations (Tactical Randomness)

Roll separately for each potion to determine where it lands:

| d10 Roll | Location | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| 1-3 | **Frontline (30%)** | Lands within 10 feet of melee combatants (Barbarian/Fighter). Easy pickup for frontline, requires movement for backline. |
| 4-7 | **Mid-Arena (40%)** | Lands near central terrain feature—altar (Past) or orrery (Future). Contested space, both PCs and enemies nearby. |
| 8-9 | **Backline (20%)** | Lands near Rangers/Cleric (backline position). Safe pickup for ranged characters. |
| 10 | **Near Enemies (10%)** | Lands within 10 feet of Knight Prime or Ascendant Mage. Risky retrieval—opportunity attacks or danger zone. |

**GM Tip:** Place tokens or mark locations on map. PCs can see where potions landed and must decide whether to risk movement to retrieve them.

### Tactical Decisions Created

- **Risk vs. Reward:** Do you spend movement/actions to retrieve potions, or continue attacking weak targets?
- **Contested Potions:** Mid-arena potions create tactical tension. Do you dash to grab it before enemies position to block?
- **Dangerous Potions:** Potions near enemies (10% chance) reward brave PCs. A Barbarian with Rage resistance might risk opportunity attack to grab potion for backline ally.
- **Action Economy:** Drinking potion costs bonus action. Rangers using Hunter's Mark (bonus action) or Fighter planning Action Surge must choose.

### Enemy Response

- **Enemies do NOT pick up or drink potions** (not honorable enough, or "beneath them" thematically).
- **Enemies MAY position to prevent PC retrieval:** Knight Prime might stand on a potion location to block access, forcing PCs to Shove or bypass him.
- **Ascendant Mage might use Dimension Door** to reposition near a contested potion, creating danger zone.

### Crowd's Favor Integration

**Bonus Favor Opportunities:**
- **Risky Retrieval:** PC who retrieves a potion from "Near Enemies" location (within 10 feet of enemy) while under threat gains **+1 [[crowds_favor|Favor]]** for bravery.
- **Dramatic Catch:** PC who catches potion with Athletics check (GM discretion, if potion arc lands awkwardly) and succeeds gains **+1 Favor** for style points.
- **Selfless Act:** PC who retrieves potion in danger but gives it to wounded ally (instead of drinking self) gains **+1 Favor** for heroism.

### Flavor and Roleplay

**Visual Description:**
"From the stands above, small vials with glowing azure liquid arc downward—citizens throwing their personal healing draughts into the arena! The glass vials land with delicate *tink* sounds, rolling slightly on the cobblestones/crystal floor. You see [number] potions scattered across the arena!"

**Announcer Follow-Up (if PCs retrieve potions successfully):**
> "They catch the gifts of Tarsus! The crowd LOVES them! FIGHT ON!"

**Announcer Follow-Up (if PCs ignore potions):**
> "They REFUSE the crowd's mercy! Such PRIDE! Such DETERMINATION!"

### Why This Design Works

1. **Clear, Measurable Trigger:** 125 HP (50% of party HP) is easy to track. No ambiguity.
2. **One-Time Only:** Can't be exploited. Happens at most once, creates dramatic "turning point" moment.
3. **Balanced Healing:** 21-28 HP total is meaningful (10% of party HP pool) but not encounter-breaking. Extends fight by 1-2 rounds.
4. **Tactical Randomness:** Landing locations create micro-decisions. Not "free" healing—requires movement, positioning, action economy.
5. **Theatrical Integration:** Announcer involvement, crowd vote, dramatic stakes. Fits Arena's patronage theme (like Hunger Games sponsors).
6. **Crowd's Favor Synergy:** Creates new Favor-earning opportunities (risky retrieval, selfless acts).
7. **Doesn't Break Pacing:** If party is struggling badly, this gives them breathing room without invalidating enemies' pressure. If party is doing fine, this mechanic never triggers.

**Lair Actions:**
- **Temporal Fracture:** "Time itself FRACTURES! The arena TEARS at reality!"

- **Temporal Storm (warning, Round 7):** "The temporal loop STRAINS! If the weak survive much longer, the STORM will come!"
- **Temporal Storm (activation, Round 8+):** "THE OUROBOROS GROWS UNSTABLE! Past and future COLLIDE catastrophically! Time itself TEARS at reality! The loop cannot HOLD!"

**Minions & Environmental:**
- **Temporal Echoes spawn (Round 6):** "From timelines UNMADE, your own ECHOES emerge! The arena summons what you MIGHT have BEEN! Face YOURSELVES!"
- **Echo killed:** "The alternate timeline COLLAPSES! That future NEVER was!"
- **All Echoes killed:** "They've REJECTED their other selves! Only ONE timeline remains!"
- **PC destroys floating crystals:** "SHATTERED! The temporal crystals EXPLODE! BRILLIANT!"
- **Orrery sabotaged:** "The clockwork BREAKS! The master's magic WAVERS!"
- **Environmental kill (brazier, crystal explosion):** "Time's fury becomes their WEAPON! The arena itself STRIKES!"

**Arena's Mercy:**
- **Trigger (party at 50% HP):** "The heroes BLEED! They STRUGGLE against the ouroboros! Their strength WANES! TARSUS—what say you?! Shall we show MERCY to the brave?!"
- **Crowd votes yes:** "The CROWD has SPOKEN! MERCY is granted! Citizens—throw your healing draughts! Let the heroes CATCH them!"
- **PC retrieves potion from danger:** "They DARE to grab the gift under the enemy's SHADOW! FEARLESS!"
- **PC gives potion to ally:** "SELFLESS! They refuse healing for themselves! The crowd LOVES it!"
- **PC drinks potion while surrounded:** "They drink amidst the STORM! DEFIANT!"

## GM Tips

### Setup and Tracking

**Visual Tracking:**
- Use two mini-maps or VTT layers side-by-side labeled "PAST" and "FUTURE"
- Show both simultaneously so players can see which enemies await them in next timeline
- Place hourglasses above maps to indicate active timeline (or use colored borders)

**HP Tracking (CRITICAL - Four Separate Pools):**
- Temporal Knight Prime (Past) - **112 HP**
- Apprentice Mage (Past) - **35 HP** (boosted for balance)
- Chrono-Mage Ascendant (Future) - **78 HP**
- Young Knight (Future) - **55 HP** (boosted for balance)
- Temporal Echoes (if spawned) - **27 HP each** (2-3 minions)

**Lair Action Tracking:**
- Mark Initiative Count 20 on tracker with "LAIR ACTION"
- Pre-roll or choose lair actions based on tactical situation (see Lair Action Selection Guide above)
- Track which lair actions used to avoid repetition (varies encounter, keeps dynamic)
- Note: Round 3 is special—minions spawn instead of normal lair action

**Timeline Tokens:**
- **Past:** Sepia-toned or weathered tokens (legendary knight in battle-worn plate, young mage in simple apprentice robes)
- **Future:** Bright/crystalline tokens (young squire in shiny chain mail, robed archmage with glowing temporal effects)
- **Echoes:** Ghostly/translucent versions of PC tokens (unsettling mirrors)

### Player Education

**Turn 1 Dialogue (Future):**
- Have Ascendant say: "Hold them, young knight! Fight with the courage you'll one day master!"
- Make it CLEAR that killing the weak versions is the goal

**Turn 1 Dialogue (Past, Round 4):**
- Have Apprentice say: "Master, protect me! I'm not strong enough yet!"

**Temporal Awareness Announcements:**
- At top of each round, announce: "Timeline: FUTURE (or PAST). Strong: Mage/Knight. Weak: Knight/Mage. Shifts in X rounds."
- At Initiative 12 the round before shift: "TIME SHIFTS soon! Sand accelerates in the hourglass!"

**Complexity Management:**
- This is a TACTICAL PUZZLE about protection dynamics
- By round 2, players should understand: "Kill the weak one while dealing with the strong one"
- If players seem confused, have Ascendant taunt: "Foolish! You waste attacks on my prime form! Kill the WEAK if you dare break the cycle!"

### Round-by-Round Pacing Guide (Target: 10-12 Rounds)

**Rounds 1-3 (Future): Establishing Threat + Minions**
- **Active Enemies:** Ascendant (78 HP) + Young Knight (55 HP) + **Echoes spawn Round 3** (2-3 at 27 HP each)
- **Lair Actions:** Chronal Anchor (Round 1), Mirror of Ages (Round 2), **Minion Spawn** (Round 3 instead of lair action)
- **Expected Party Damage:** 40-60 HP (highest pressure phase—Slow spell, Momentary Stasis, minion attacks)
- **Expected Enemy Damage:** Young Knight takes 25-40 HP, Echoes take 10-20 HP total, Ascendant takes 10-20 HP (hard to reach)
- **GM Notes:** This is the HARDEST phase, happening FIRST. Ascendant opens with Slow (DC 17 Wis save, targets 4-5 PCs). Uses Haste on Young Knight (via Arcane Abeyance bead). Echoes spawn Round 3 and Phase Step to backline immediately. PCs learn the hard way that weak targets are priority.
- **Pacing Check:** If PCs are dominating (Young Knight already dead, Echoes killed quickly), have Ascendant use Disintegrate aggressively on biggest threat.

**Rounds 4-6 (Past): Control After Minions**
- **Active Enemies:** Knight Prime (112 HP) + Apprentice (35 HP) + Echoes (if any survived from Future)
- **Lair Actions:** Accelerate Time (Round 4), Temporal Fracture (Round 5), Chronal Anchor (Round 6)
- **Expected Party Damage:** 30-40 HP (Knight's longsword attacks, Apprentice's Magic Missile, plus lingering Echoes)
- **Expected Enemy Damage:** Apprentice takes 15-25 HP, Knight takes 20-30 HP, Echoes mopped up
- **GM Notes:** Party learns puzzle after brutal Future phase. Knight uses Guardian's Oath and legendary actions aggressively. Apprentice stays behind knight, casts Hold Person on Barbarian/Fighter. **Arena's Mercy may trigger here** if party HP drops below 125 from accumulated damage.
- **Pacing Check:** If Apprentice drops below 10 HP by Round 5, consider using Temporal Rewind (heal 2d10) as lair action in Round 6.

**Rounds 7-9 (Future Returns): Escalation Phase**
- **Active Enemies:** Ascendant (remaining HP, likely 40-60) + Young Knight (remaining HP, likely 10-25 if still alive)
- **Lair Actions:** Temporal Rewind Minor (Round 7, heal Young Knight or Ascendant), **Temporal Storm** (Round 8 if both weak targets alive) OR Chronal Anchor Escalated (if one weak target dead), Temporal Fracture Escalated (Round 9)
- **Expected Party Damage:** 35-50 HP (Temporal Storm is brutal if triggered—avg 45 HP to party)
- **Expected Enemy Damage:** Young Knight likely killed this phase (priority target), Ascendant takes 40-60 HP
- **GM Notes:** **CRITICAL PHASE.** If Young Knight still alive at Round 8, Temporal Storm activates—party takes massive damage and learns urgency. If Young Knight dead, only Ascendant remains (fighting to prevent paradox). This is a "do or die" phase for weak targets.
- **Pacing Check:** If both weak targets still alive at Round 8, **must** use Temporal Storm to create urgency. If party struggling badly, Arena's Mercy triggers (if not already used).

**Rounds 10-12 (Past Returns): Endgame**
- **Active Enemies:** Knight Prime (remaining HP, likely 60-80) + Apprentice (remaining HP, likely 0-25)
- **Lair Actions:** Accelerate Time Escalated (Round 10), Temporal Rewind Major Escalated (Round 11, heal both if alive), Causality Cascade Escalated (Round 12)
- **Expected Party Damage:** 20-40 HP (Enraged Knight if Apprentice dead, or desperate defense if alive)
- **Expected Enemy Damage:** Apprentice killed (priority), Knight killed or enters final Rage
- **GM Notes:** If Apprentice already killed in Rounds 4-6, Knight is enraged (advantage on attacks, resistance to all damage). If Apprentice still alive, Knight desperately defends using all legendary actions. Knight's last stand is brutal but beatable.
- **Victory:** Likely by Round 11-12 if PCs played tactically. If combat reaches Round 13+, remaining strong version offers conditional surrender: "You have broken the cycle... I yield." (Partial victory, reduced rewards).

### Escalation and Adjustment Triggers

**If PCs Dominating (Amp Up Difficulty):**
- **Trigger:** Both weak targets still alive at Round 8
- **Response:** Temporal Storm activates (major damage spike)
- **Trigger:** PCs above 75% HP at Round 6+
- **Response:** Lair actions target more aggressively, spawn 3 Echoes instead of 2
- **Trigger:** Both strong enemies below 50% HP before Round 9
- **Response:** Lair actions favor healing (Temporal Rewind spam), strong enemies fight more aggressively (Knight grapples PCs, Ascendant uses Disintegrate early)

**If PCs Struggling (Provide Relief):**
- **Trigger:** Party HP drops below 125 (50% of ~250 total)
- **Response:** Arena's Mercy activates (1d4 healing potions land, see section above)
- **Trigger:** 2+ PCs unconscious before Round 9
- **Response:** Enemies make tactical mistakes (Ascendant wastes Disintegrate on high-HP Barbarian, Knight uses Temporal Slash instead of Protective Parry, Echoes don't use Phase Step optimally)
- **Trigger:** Combat drags past Round 14 with PCs struggling
- **Response:** Strong versions offer conditional surrender (honorable defeat, PCs survive but reduced rewards)

### Environmental Interactions and Persistence

**Track Changes Across Timelines:**
- **Tipped Brazier (Past):** Remains tipped when Past returns (scorch marks persist). Brazier no longer functional.
- **Destroyed Floating Crystals (Future):** Remain destroyed when Future returns (crystal debris scattered). Reduces future environmental hazards.
- **Sabotaged Orrery (Future, DC 15 Arcana check):** Stays sabotaged, imposes disadvantage on Ascendant's concentration checks for rest of combat.
- **Blood Spilled:** Show continuity—blood stains remain on cobblestones (Past) or shimmer on crystal floor (Future).

**Environmental Synergy with Lair Actions:**
- **Temporal Fracture** can push PCs into braziers (Past, 2d6 fire + DC 13 Dex) or floating crystals (Future, 2d8 force + DC 14 Dex)
- **Accelerate Time** allows enemies to reach weapon racks (Past) or orrery cover (Future) faster
- **Causality Cascade** punishes PCs who tipped braziers for damage (counts as "dealing damage")

### When Weak Targets Die Early or Late

**Apprentice Dies Rounds 1-3 (Fast Kill):**
- Knight Prime enters RAGE immediately (advantage on attacks, resistance to all damage, loses legendary actions)
- Future timeline (Rounds 4-6) has only Ascendant + Young Knight (easier without Knight Prime backup in Rounds 7-9)
- Past timeline (Rounds 7-9) has enraged Knight alone—dangerous but manageable
- Victory likely by Round 9-10 (shorter encounter)
- Lair actions focus on healing Knight (Temporal Rewind spam) and damage (Temporal Fracture, Causality Cascade)

**Young Knight Dies Rounds 4-6 (Fast Kill):**
- Ascendant uses Master's Will (reaction revive at 1 HP) immediately
- Young Knight revived and Hasted again, fights desperately
- If killed AGAIN, stays dead (no second revive)
- Future timeline (Rounds 10-12) has only Ascendant (pure caster fight)
- Victory likely by Round 10-11 (shorter encounter)
- Lair actions focus on control (Chronal Anchor, Mirror of Ages) and damage (Causality Cascade)

**Both Weak Targets Die Before Round 8 (Optimal Play):**
- NO Temporal Storm (major threat avoided—party did well)
- Encounter ends Round 9-11
- Only strong enemies remain: Knight Prime (enraged) + Ascendant (alone)
- Lair actions defensive (healing, control) rather than punishing
- **Reward:** PCs gain +5 Favor for tactical genius, Arena title "Ouroboros Breakers"

**Both Weak Targets Alive Past Round 8 (Suboptimal Play):**
- Temporal Storm activates Round 8 (and every 2 rounds after: 10, 12, etc.)
- Extended encounter, likely reaches Round 12-14
- High resource drain—Arena's Mercy likely triggered, multiple close calls
- Temporal Storm deals ~45 HP total to party each time (5 PCs × avg 9 HP)
- **Lesson:** Focus weak targets early or suffer consequences

### Minion Management (Temporal Echoes)

**Spawn Timing:** Round 6, Initiative Count 20 (instead of normal lair action)

**Tactical Impact:**
- Before Echoes: Backline can "stand and shoot" safely
- After Echoes: Rangers/Cleric must reposition, use movement defensively

**Action Economy:**
- 2-3 Echoes = 4-6 extra attacks per round against backline
- Forces defensive reactions (Dodge, Disengage, healing)
- Reduces party offensive output—extends encounter by 2-3 rounds naturally

**Kill Priority:**
- Echoes have 27 HP each—Ranger with Hunter's Mark (1d6+3 bonus) + 2 attacks = ~25 damage, can drop one in 1-2 rounds
- If ignored, Echoes whittle down backline HP (Life Cleric becomes priority target)
- Use Phase Step aggressively—Echoes know they're squishy, avoid being pinned

**Phase Step Counters:**
- Grapple an Echo before it acts (it can't Phase Step while grappled)
- Ready actions to attack Echo "when it finishes Phase Step" (melee range)
- Area effects (if PCs have any) hit multiple Echoes if clustered

### Arena's Mercy Timing

**Track Party HP Total:** At end of each round, calculate sum of all PC current HP.

**Trigger:** If total ≤ 125 HP (50% of ~250 pool), Arena's Mercy activates (once only).

**Most Likely Timing:** End of Round 5 or 6 (after Ascendant's Slow + Momentary Stasis + minion spawn).

**GM Discretion:** If party at 127 HP (close to threshold) and taking heavy hits, can trigger early for drama.

**Potion Landing:** Roll d10 for each potion (1d4 total potions) to determine location. Place tokens visibly—PCs must decide risk vs. reward.

**Enemy Positioning:** Enemies MAY block potion access but don't pick them up. Knight might stand on potion to force Shove contest. Ascendant might Dimension Door near contested potion.

### Balancing on the Fly

**If PCs Struggling (Subtle Helps):**
- Ascendant wastes Disintegrate on high-HP Barbarian (50-70 damage, Barbarian survives)
- Knight uses Temporal Slash (damage) instead of Protective Parry (defense)
- Echoes don't use Phase Step optimally (stay in frontline reach)
- Reduce lair action frequency (skip a round) or use less severe ones (Accelerate Time instead of Temporal Fracture)

**If PCs Steamrolling (Subtle Challenges):**
- Ascendant saves Counterspell specifically for healing spells (denies Life Cleric big heals)
- Knight grapples PCs trying to reach Apprentice (contested Athletics, advantage from Guardian's Oath)
- Echoes coordinate Phase Step timing (all three Phase Step same turn, surround Cleric)
- Use escalated lair actions earlier (Round 7 instead of Round 8)

**Victory Conditions:**
- **Optimal:** Both weak targets dead by Round 10, party above 100 HP total, no PCs unconscious. **Full victory + Arena title.**
- **Standard:** Both weak targets dead by Round 12, party 50-100 HP total, 0-1 PCs unconscious. **Standard victory.**
- **Pyrrhic:** Both weak targets dead by Round 14+, party below 50 HP total, 2+ PCs unconscious. **Victory with heavy cost.**
- **Conditional:** Strong versions surrender Round 13+, PCs struggling. **Partial victory, reduced rewards.**

## Aftermath Seeds

**Character Development:**
- **Temporal Scars:** PCs who survived both timelines gain "Chrono-Touched" trait—occasionally experience moments in "wrong" order (déjà vu or premonition). DM gives cryptic hints about future events 1/session.
- **Injury - Temporal Lag:** PC who was hit by *Momentary Stasis* or *slow* repeatedly develops "Temporal Lag"—1/day, DM can declare they act last in initiative order that round (as if stuck in slow time). Cosmetic curse, unsettling. Can be removed with *greater restoration* or 1 week of rest.
- **Injury - Echo Trauma:** PC who killed their own Temporal Echo develops "Identity Crisis"—occasionally sees their reflection move independently or hears their own voice from empty rooms. Cosmetic, unsettling. Fades after 1d4 weeks.
- **Injury - Storm Survivor:** PC who survived Temporal Storm (rolled 1-7, took 3d10 damage) develops "Temporal Instability"—hair grays prematurely by 1d10 years' worth, or fingertips occasionally flicker translucent for 1d4 seconds. Cosmetic only.

**Rewards & Recognition:**
- **Legendary Moment:** If PCs killed BOTH weak versions before Round 10 (fast victory), gain Arena title: **"Ouroboros Breakers."** Time mages across Tarsus hear the name. +2 [[crowds_favor|Favor]] to starting Favor in future fights.
- **Efficient Victory:** If PCs killed both weak versions without either strong version using their resurrection ability (Temporal Anchor, Master's Will), gain bonus title: **"Temporal Surgeons."** Recognized for precise targeting.
- **Survival Achievement:** If PCs survived Temporal Storm AND killed both weak targets same combat, gain title: **"Storm Walkers."** Known for endurance against temporal chaos.

**Political Consequences:**
- **Political - Chronomancy Investigation:** Arena's use of "self-sustaining temporal loop" may violate Tarsus's chronomancy laws (forbidden after "The Unraveling" 200 years ago). Imperial magistrates investigate. Arena master needs PCs to testify that fight was "theatrical illusion, not true time magic" (perjury). Refusing earns magistrate's respect but Arena master's ire. Lying earns Arena master's favor but guilt.
- **Political - Temporal Scholar Interest:** A temporal scholar impressed by PCs' ability to "break an ouroboros" offers contract to investigate temporal anomaly in the Wastes—well-paid (500 gp) but dangerous time magic research expedition.

**World Impact:**
- **Rumor - Temporal Ripples:** Breaking the temporal loop caused ripples—some Tarsus citizens report seeing "ghost" versions of themselves from slightly different timelines (their past or future selves bleeding through). Occurs in 10-foot radius around PCs for 1d4 days. Unsettling but harmless.
- **Rumor - Arena Damage:** The arena floor (Past cobblestones or Future crystals) now has a permanent "scar"—a 5-foot-diameter spiral pattern where the ouroboros collapsed. Glows faintly under moonlight. Becomes minor tourist attraction.

**Loot Options:**
- **Temporal Knight's Longsword (Past version, +1 longsword, rare):** Deals extra 1d6 force damage. Once per day, after making an attack roll, can "rewind" and reroll, taking better result. **Quirk:** Blade sometimes "remembers" enemies it killed in past timelines—when drawn near undead or constructs, hums and deals +1d4 radiant damage to those creature types (echoes of past battles).
- **Apprentice's Temporal Focus (amulet, uncommon):** Grants bearer ability to cast *shield* 3/day (no spell slot required). Bearer ages 1 day per use (cosmetic, no mechanical effect unless extreme overuse over months—after 365 uses, gain 1 year of aging).
- **Chrono-Mage's Temporal Robes (robes, rare):** Grants advantage on saves vs. time magic (*slow*, *haste*, *time stop*, etc.). Once per day, when hit by an attack, can use reaction to "phase" briefly—attacker rerolls with disadvantage. AC 12 + Dex (up to +3).
- **Young Knight's Training Shield (+1 shield, uncommon):** When bearer uses the Help action in combat, the helped ally gains +1d4 to their roll (enthusiastic support). Once per day, bearer can use a reaction when an ally within 5 feet is hit to grant them +2 AC against that attack (eager protection).
- **Temporal Echo Residue (consumable, uncommon, 1d3 pieces):** Small crystalline shards left when Temporal Echoes die. Can be crushed as a bonus action to cast *blink* on self (no spell slot, lasts 1 minute). Single use. Worth 50 gp each to collectors.
- **Orrery Gear (miscellaneous, rare):** If PCs sabotaged the orrery, can claim a gear from the mechanism. Acts as an Arcane Focus that grants +1 to spell attack rolls when casting spells with "time" or "speed" effects (*haste*, *slow*, *expeditious retreat*, etc.). Worth 200 gp to artificers.

**Downtime Activities:**
- **Downtime - Spellbook Study:** Chrono-Mage Ascendant's spellbook can be claimed—contains *slow*, *haste*, and two Chronurgy spells (*gift of alacrity*, *fortune's favor*). Wizard PCs can copy them (standard rules: 50 gp and 2 hours per spell level). Also contains research notes on "temporal immortality through self-protection paradox" (lore hook for future adventures).
- **Downtime - Arena Meditation:** PCs can return to the arena and meditate where the ouroboros collapsed (the spiral scar). DC 15 Arcana check. On success, gain insight: "You see fleeting visions of yourself in the fight—but different. You made different choices. The timelines that ALMOST were." Philosophical moment.
