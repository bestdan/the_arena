# Creeping Frost

- **Hook:** "Can they outrun winter's bite?" The arena floor is enchanted ice, and a spreading frost wave emanates from the center, freezing everything it touches. Gladiators must continuously move toward the arena walls as the safe zone shrinks. Stand still too long, and become a frozen statue for the crowd's amusement.
- **Party:** 4-6 PCs, level 6+. Tests movement efficiency, resource management under pressure, and ability to fight while retreating.

## Arena Layout
- Circular arena (150-foot diameter) covered in magically smooth ice (difficult terrain for non-ice-adapted creatures).
- **Frost Epicenter:** Central pillar (20 feet tall) emanates spreading cold.
- **Frost Wave:** Begins at 10-foot radius from center; expands 10 feet outward at initiative count 20 (losing ties).
- **Safe Zone:** Area beyond the frost wave's edge. Shrinks each round until only the outer 20-foot ring remains by round 12.
- **Outer Wall:** 10-foot-high stone wall with climbing holds (Athletics DC 12 to scale); spectators watch from above.

## Freezing Mechanic
- **Frost Wave Touch:** Any creature that starts or ends its turn within the frost wave must make Constitution save DC 15.
  - Fail: Take 3d8 cold damage and speed reduced by 10 feet until end of next turn (stacks).
  - Fail by 5+: Creature is **restrained** (frozen in place, encased in ice) until they use an action to break free (Strength DC 15) or ally breaks them free (1 action, AC 12, 15 HP to shatter ice).
- **Ice Floor:** Entire arena is difficult terrain; moving 1 foot costs 2 feet of movement (except ice-adapted creatures).
- **Speed Reduction Stacking:** Multiple failed saves reduce speed cumulatively. Speed 0 = automatic restraint on next frost wave contact.

## Frost Wave Progression
- **Round 1-3:** Wave at 10-30 feet radius; plenty of space, enemies push PCs toward center.
- **Round 4-6:** Wave at 40-60 feet radius; space tightens, panic sets in.
- **Round 7-9:** Wave at 70-90 feet radius; cramped fighting, desperate scrambles.
- **Round 10-12:** Wave at 100-120 feet radius; only outer ring safe, enemies cornered with PCs.
- **Round 13+:** Wave reaches walls (full arena frozen); combat ends if PCs haven't climbed out.

## Enemies (cold-adapted predators)
- 2 Winter Wolves (CR 3 each; ice-walk ability ignores difficult terrain, cold breath weapon, pack tactics).
- 3 Ice Mephits (CR 1/4 each; frost breath, death burst creates ice patches that are extra slippery—Acrobatics DC 14 or fall prone).
- 2 Yeti Abominations (CR 3 each; chilling gaze causes fear, freezing melee attacks, immune to cold).
- 1 Young Remorhaz (CR 5; burrows under ice, heated body contrasts with environment, swallow mechanic).
- 1 Frost Giant Thane (CR 9; reduced HP to ~130 for balance; hurls ice boulders, commands other enemies, immune to cold).
- **Flex:** For 4 PCs, remove 1 Yeti and the Remorhaz. For 6 PCs, add 1 more Winter Wolf and upgrade Frost Giant to full stats.

## Enemy Tactics
- **Winter Wolves:** Use superior mobility to herd PCs toward frost wave center; breath weapon forces saves.
- **Ice Mephits:** Suicide attacks in cramped spaces; death bursts create ice patches to slow PCs further.
- **Yetis:** Chilling gaze forces frightened PCs to flee (potentially into frost wave); zone control.
- **Remorhaz:** Burrows to surprise PCs; heated body deals fire damage to grapplers (ironic contrast to cold theme).
- **Frost Giant:** Hurls ice chunks to knock PCs prone on slippery ice; throws enemies into frost wave.

## Crowd Favor Hooks
- Successfully save against frost wave 5 times in a row: +1 [[crowds_favor_mechanic|Favor]] for resilience.
- Break an ally free from ice restraint in 1 action: +2 Favor for heroic rescue.
- Defeat an enemy while both in the frost wave (taking damage): +2 Favor for reckless bravery.
- Shove an enemy into the frost wave using *thunderwave* or similar: +1 Favor per enemy.
- Climb the outer wall to escape frost wave dramatically while fighting: +2 Favor for spectacle.
- Kill the Frost Giant with fire damage: +3 Favor for poetic justice.
- Use ice floor against enemies (trip, slide, creative tactics): +1 Favor for environmental mastery.

## Hazards and Environment
- **Ice Floor:** Difficult terrain slows everyone; Acrobatics checks to avoid falling when hit.
- **Frost Wave:** Constant pressure to move outward; CR 15 environmental threat.
- **Ice Restraint:** Being frozen is death sentence unless rescued; allies must choose between progress and saving frozen PCs.
- **Ice Patches:** Mephit death bursts create ultra-slippery zones (DC 14 Acrobatics or fall prone, lose rest of movement).
- **Wall Climbing:** Escape option but leaves PCs vulnerable while climbing (opportunity attacks, ranged attacks).

## Announcer Beats
- Opening: "WINTER COMES TO TARSUS! The ice spreads! The frost hungers! Move or become monuments!"
- First frost wave expansion: "The cold advances! Ten feet closer to DOOM! Run, gladiators, RUN!"
- PC frozen: "Encased in ice! A statue before our eyes! Will they shatter—or break free?!"
- Enemy frozen: "The Yeti—frozen by its own element! IRONY!"
- Desperate scramble: "They flee to the walls! The arena shrinks! Nowhere left to hide!"
- Heroic rescue: "She smashes the ice! Her companion breathes again! LOYALTY!"
- Victory: "Survivors cling to the outer wall! The frost recedes! They have outlasted winter itself!"

## GM Tips
- Use concentric circles on battle map to show frost wave expansion; visual clarity is critical.
- Announce next wave expansion at start of each round: "The wave will reach 40 feet next turn!"
- Narrate cold viscerally: "Your breath freezes," "Fingers numb," "Ice crystals form on your armor."
- Track speed reductions publicly; players need to see the death spiral approaching.
- Enemies should take advantage of chaos—Winter Wolves herd, Yetis frighten toward wave.
- If PC gets frozen, make it dramatic: "The ice races up your legs! Your arms lock! You can't move!"
- Let PCs use fire spells creatively: "Can I melt a path?" (Yes, but temporary, 1 round reprieve.)
- Consider giving exhaustion to PCs who succeed too many saves (representing hypothermia).

## Aftermath Seeds
- Patron interest: Ice trade merchant impressed by "cold endurance"; offers contract to guard frost shipments through desert (lucrative, paradoxical).
- Rumor: The frost pillar houses a trapped ice elemental princess—freeing her might curse/bless the party.
- Downtime: Winter Wolf pelt can be harvested (resistance to cold for 8 hours if worn, furrier required, 100 gp cost).
- Injury: PC frozen solid for 2+ rounds develops "Frostbite Trauma"—permanent cold sensitivity (disadvantage on saves vs. cold, roleplaying fear of ice).
- Political: Arena mages questioned about frost wave malfunction—was it meant to stop, or was this attempted murder?
- Reward: Frost Giant's ice crown (can be sold for 300 gp or grants *resistance to cold damage* when worn, 1/day cast *ice storm*).
