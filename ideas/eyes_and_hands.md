# Eyes and Hands

- **Hook:** Cursed masks seal half the gladiators' sight while binding the others' arms. The Blinded can fight but cannot see; the Bound can see but cannot attack. Only by pairing Sight with Strength can they navigate the maze, find keys, and defeat enemies. The crowd watches through scrying screens—one shows what the Blinded experience (darkness), the other what the Bound observe (helpless clarity). Ultimate trust or ultimate failure.
- **Party:** 4-6 PCs. Half are Blinded (masks sealed over eyes), half are Bound (arms magically restrained). Must form mandatory pairs.

## Arena Layout
- 80×80-foot labyrinth of 10-foot-wide corridors with shifting walls (rotate every 4 rounds).
- Three key pedestals scattered throughout: Blinded PCs cannot locate them (Perception auto-fail); Bound PCs can see but cannot retrieve (requires free hands).
- Central chamber (20×20 feet) houses the Keymaster Boss; locked door requires all three keys simultaneously.
- Traps triggered by pressure plates (visible only to Bound PCs); Blinded must be guided around them.
- Scattered combat encounters in dead-ends and junctions.

## Curse Mechanics (Core Challenge)
**Blinded PCs:**
- Automatically fail all Perception checks related to sight.
- Attack rolls have disadvantage (cannot see targets).
- Cannot read, cannot navigate without verbal guidance.
- CAN fight, cast spells, use items, move (if directed).
- Rely entirely on Bound partner's descriptions: "Two orcs, north side, 20 feet out."
- Gain advantage on hearing-based Perception (heightened senses compensation).

**Bound PCs:**
- Arms magically restrained to sides (cannot be freed by normal means).
- Cannot make weapon attacks, cannot cast spells with somatic components, cannot use items requiring hands.
- CAN see perfectly, navigate, spot traps, read clues, provide tactical guidance.
- CAN kick (unarmed strike, 1d4 + Str damage), headbutt, or use environmental objects via creative descriptions.
- Must verbally guide Blinded partner through obstacles: "Stop! Spike pit 5 feet ahead! Go left!"

**Pairing Requirement:**
- Each Blinded PC must pair with one Bound PC (GM assigns or players choose).
- Pairs must stay within 30 feet or both suffer penalty: Blinded auto-fail Dex saves, Bound lose voice (magically muted).
- Communication is MANDATORY; encourage constant verbal exchange.

## Enemies (exploit curses)
**Ambush Predators:**
- 4 Invisible Stalkers (reskin as Shadow Assassins, CR 2; visible to Bound but not Blinded).
- 2 Silence Casters (use Cultists with *silence* spell, CR 1/2; attempt to separate pairs by muting Bound guides).
- 3 Displacer Beasts (CR 3; displacement illusions confuse even Bound PCs' guidance).

**Keymaster Guardian (Central Chamber):**
- 1 Spectral Sentinel (reskin Stone Golem, CR 10; immune to non-magical attacks, requires teamwork to bypass).
- Can only be damaged if Blinded PC attacks where Bound PC directs precisely (requires called shots, disadvantage offset by advantage from Bound guidance).

**Flex:** For 4 PCs (2 pairs), remove 2 Invisible Stalkers and 1 Displacer Beast. For 6 PCs (3 pairs), add 1 more Displacer Beast and 1 Beholder Zombie (CR 5; eye rays targeting Bound PCs).

## Key Retrieval Puzzle
**Three Pedestals:**
- Only visible to Bound PCs (Blinded cannot Perceive them).
- Only retrievable by Blinded PCs (requires free hands to grasp keys).
- Bound must guide Blinded: "10 feet forward... 5 feet right... reach out waist-high..."
- Each key is trapped: Bound must spot trap (Perception DC 14) and guide Blinded through disarm (Thieves' Tools DC 13, guided by Bound's directions).

**Central Door:**
- All three keys must be inserted simultaneously by Blinded PCs (requires 3 pairs coordinating timing).
- Bound PCs must align Blinded partners: "You're at the left slot... reach forward... NOW!"

## Cooperation Tactics
**Combat Synergy:**
- **Guided Strike:** Bound PC uses Help action (describes enemy position perfectly); Blinded PC's attack loses disadvantage (becomes straight roll).
- **Trust Fall:** Blinded PC charges blindly where Bound directs; advantage on damage if Bound's guidance was accurate.
- **Environmental Weapons:** Bound identifies hazard (spike pit, collapsing pillar); Blinded shoves enemy into it via precise directions.

**Navigation:**
- Bound PC constantly updates: "Wall 3 feet left, corridor ahead, trap at your feet—STOP!"
- Blinded PC trusts completely; wrong directions = damage from traps or walls (1d6 bludgeoning).

## Objectives
- **Primary:** Retrieve all three keys and unlock Central Chamber.
- **Secondary:** Defeat Keymaster Guardian via coordinated attacks.
- **Bonus:** Complete maze with no Blinded PC triggering traps (perfect guidance).

## Crowd Favor Hooks
- Blinded PC lands killing blow via Bound's perfect guidance: +2 [[crowds_favor|Favor]] to both.
- Bound PC guides Blinded through trap sequence without triggering: +2 Favor to both.
- Retrieve a key without triggering trap via flawless coordination: +1 Favor to pair.
- Blinded PC executes [[panache|Panache]] strike while relying entirely on Bound's callout: +3 Favor split.
- Bound PC uses environment to advantage (calls out collapsing pillar, guides shove perfectly): +2 Favor.
- All pairs synchronize key insertion on first attempt: +3 Favor to all.
- Blinded PC saves Bound from enemy while unable to see threat (reacts to Bound's warning): +2 Favor to both.
- Pair survives Silence spell by improvising non-verbal communication (tapping, tugging): +2 Favor for adaptation.

## Traps and Hazards
**Visible Only to Bound:**
- Pressure plate spike traps: 10-foot squares, trigger on 50+ pounds, 3d6 piercing, Dex DC 14 to avoid.
- Swinging blade pendulums: cross 15-foot corridor, activate when approached, 2d10 slashing, Dex DC 13.
- Collapsing ceiling tiles: marked with cracks, fall when stepped under, 4d6 bludgeoning, Dex DC 15.

**Shifting Walls:**
- Every 4 rounds on initiative count 20, walls rotate 90 degrees.
- Bound PCs see walls glowing before shift (30-second warning); must guide pairs to safe zones.
- Blinded caught in rotating wall: 2d6 bludgeoning, pushed 10 feet.

## Announcer Beats
- Opening: "Eyes without Hands! Hands without Eyes! Can trust bridge the curse?!"
- First guided strike: "PRECISION! The Bound sees, the Blinded STRIKES! Perfect unity!"
- Trap avoided: "Death at their feet—but they DANCE PAST! Guided to safety!"
- Key retrieved: "One key claimed! Communication conquers complexity!"
- Silence spell cast: "The voices DIE! Can gestures suffice?!"
- Door unlocked: "THREE KEYS! ONE MOMENT! The door YIELDS to cooperation!"
- Keymaster defeated: "The guardian FALLS! Eyes and Hands as ONE unstoppable force!"

## GM Tips
- Emphasize roleplay: Bound PCs must describe everything vividly ("Two orcs, left is closer, right has a shield").
- Blinded PCs should keep eyes closed or wear actual blindfolds for immersion (player choice).
- Silence spells are the ultimate test; pairs must improvise tapping codes or physical guidance.
- Track 30-foot separation strictly; enforce voice-loss penalty harshly to stress pairing importance.
- Let Bound PCs feel helpless in combat; they can only watch and guide, not act.
- Let Blinded PCs feel powerful when guided well; their strikes depend entirely on trust.
- Use two maps: one showing full layout (Bound perspective), one blacked out (Blinded perspective).
- Encourage creative communication: "Tap my shoulder when to swing!" "Squeeze my arm when enemy's close!"
- Shifting walls create urgency; remind Bound to guide pairs to safe zones before rotation.

## Aftermath Seeds
- **Trust Forged:** Paired PCs develop deep bond; mechanically, gain +1 to Help actions when assisting that partner in future.
- **Patron Interest:** Spy network impressed by blind navigation skills; offers contract for stealth infiltration missions.
- **Rumor:** Cursed masks were ancient interrogation tools—blind the subject, bind the accomplice, see who breaks first.
- **Injury:** Blinded PC develops minor light sensitivity for days after; bright light causes brief discomfort (cosmetic).
- **Legendary Moment:** If team completed with zero trap triggers and perfect key insertions, crowd erupts; patrons commission paired statues: one blindfolded, one bound, standing triumphant.
- **Political:** Arena masters recognize potential; plan future "sensory deprivation" events (deaf+mute, paralyzed+invisible, etc.).
- **Downtime:** Blind-fighting training available; Blinded PCs can learn to fight better without sight (Fighting Style: Blind Fighting from Tasha's).
- **Equipment:** Cursed masks become trophy items; some PCs keep them as grim reminders of cooperation's power.
