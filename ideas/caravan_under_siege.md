# Caravan Under Siege

- **Hook:** A gilded merchant wagon crosses the arena sands, laden with "treasure" (actually weighted crates). Waves of raiders attempt to overwhelm the escorts and loot the cargo. The gladiators must protect the caravan as it trundles toward safety. Each crate stolen is a mark against them—lose too many, and the patrons' investment vanishes.
- **Party:** 4-6 PCs, level 4-5. Emphasizes mobile defense, target prioritization, and escort tactics.

## Arena Layout
- 120-foot journey from West Gate to East Gate; the wagon moves 20 feet per round automatically.
- Central trade road (40 feet wide) flanked by rocky outcrops (half-cover, 5 feet high).
- Three ambush zones: narrow canyon (Round 2-3), open sands (Round 4-5), final approach with barricades (Round 6-7).
- The wagon has AC 15, 80 HP. If destroyed, all crates are automatically "stolen."
- Wagon contains **6 treasure crates** locked to its bed; raiders can steal them with actions.

## Attrition Mechanics
- **Crate Limit:** If **4 or more crates** are stolen, the caravan fails and patrons lose faith.
- **Graduated Rewards:**
  - 0 crates stolen: +5 Favor to all, bonus gold purse from "grateful merchant."
  - 1 crate stolen: +4 Favor to all.
  - 2 crates stolen: +3 Favor to all.
  - 3 crates stolen: +2 Favor to all, crowd mutters about "acceptable losses."
  - 4+ crates stolen: Mission fails; no Favor earned, lose 1 Favor each from angry patrons.
- **Stealing Mechanics:**
  - Raider must be adjacent to wagon and use action to make DC 15 Sleight of Hand check.
  - On success, raider grabs crate and must carry it 30 feet away to "escape route" (marked zones).
  - Crate carrier has speed reduced to 20 feet and disadvantage on Dex saves.
  - PCs can retrieve stolen crates with same action (auto-success if uncontested).

## Waves (7 rounds to complete journey)
**Round 1-2 - Probing Attacks:**
- 4 Bandits (CR 1/8) dash in from rocky outcrops, testing defenses.
- 1 Bandit Captain (CR 2) appears Round 2, coordinating theft attempts.
- Flex: 4 PCs = 3 Bandits, no Captain. 6 PCs = add 2 Scouts with shortbows.

**Round 3-4 - The Mounted Raid:**
- 2 Hobgoblin Raiders on Wargs (use Hobgoblin + Worg stats, CR 1) gallop in, attempting grab-and-runs.
- 3 Goblins (CR 1/4) emerge from sand pits, using Nimble Escape to dart toward wagon.
- 1 Bugbear (CR 1) sneaks from rear, targeting isolated defenders.
- Flex: 4 PCs = remove Bugbear. 6 PCs = add another mounted Hobgoblin.

**Round 5-7 - The Final Assault:**
- 2 Ogres (CR 2) charge from front, attempting to smash wagon or grab multiple crates.
- 4 Tribal Warriors (CR 1/8) swarm sides with grappling hooks, climbing onto wagon.
- 1 Orc Eye of Gruumsh (CR 2) blasts defenders with spells while 2 Orcs (CR 1/2) coordinate theft.
- Flex: 4 PCs = replace Ogres with 1 Owlbear. 6 PCs = add Orog leading the final charge.

## Objectives
- **Primary:** Prevent 4 or more crates from being stolen before wagon reaches East Gate.
- **Secondary:** Keep wagon intact (above 0 HP).
- **Bonus:** No crates stolen at all (+5 Favor + patron bonus).

## Crowd Favor Hooks
- Stop a raider carrying a crate with a killing blow before they escape: +2 Favor.
- Retrieve a stolen crate and return it to wagon in same turn: +2 Favor.
- Protect the wagon from a direct attack that would destroy it (taking the hit yourself or intercepting): +2 Favor.
- Declare [[panache|Panache]] attack while standing on the moving wagon: +2 Favor if successful.
- Coordinate with ally to stop theft attempt (one readied action triggers another's movement): +1 Favor to both.
- Single PC defends one side of wagon alone for a full round: +2 Favor.

## Hazards and Mobile Combat
- **Moving Wagon:** PCs on wagon move with it (20 feet/round). Jumping on/off requires 10 feet of movement.
- **Mounted Enemies:** Warg riders can gallop 60 feet, grab crate, and flee. Use readied actions or AoE to stop them.
- **Rocky Outcrops:** Enemies gain half-cover when behind them; PCs can use them for tactical positioning.
- **Sand Pits:** Scattered 10-foot squares of difficult terrain; wagon bypasses but combatants slow.
- **Grappling Hooks:** Tribal Warriors throw hooks (15-foot range) to climb onto wagon (Athletics DC 12). PCs can cut ropes as bonus action.

## Announcer Beats
- Opening: "Behold the Caravan Under Siege! Will our champions guard the merchant's gold—or watch it vanish into the sands?"
- First theft: "A crate is taken! The wagon bleeds treasure! Can they recover it?!"
- Mounted raid: "Riders on beasts! Swift as the wind! The gold is in MOTION!"
- Wagon damage: "The wagon shudders! Will it hold? Will it break beneath the assault?!"
- Crate recovery: "RETRIEVED! Snatched from the jaws of failure! The crowd ROARS!"
- Victory (0 crates lost): "NOT ONE COIN LOST! Perfect! Flawless! Tarsus salutes its guardians!"
- Defeat (4+ crates lost): "The wagon limps forward, emptied and shamed! The patrons weep!"

## GM Tips
- Use a timer or visual tracker for wagon progress and crate status; keep tension high.
- Describe raiders shouting to each other about which crate to target; creates urgency.
- If defenders are overwhelmed, have one raider flee with a crate instead of fighting, forcing choice: pursue or defend?
- Wagon driver (NPC) can shout warnings about incoming threats; use as exposition.
- Mounted enemies should gallop in, grab, and flee—don't let them stand and fight unless pinned.
- If PC uses [[last_stand|Last Stand]] to save a crate, make it legendary: +3 Favor + announcer erupts.
- Consider letting crowd throw caltrops or oil to slow raiders if PCs are earning high Favor.

## Aftermath Seeds
- **Perfect Defense (0 stolen):** Wealthy merchant patron offers permanent sponsorship; "You've earned my trust—and my coin."
- **Close Call (3 stolen):** Merchant publicly complains but privately thanks PCs; offers discounted goods.
- **Theft Tally:** Each stolen crate becomes a rumor: "They let three through!" Future opponents may mock them.
- **Rival Gladiators:** Another team brags they could've done better; sets up future grudge match.
- **Downtime:** Access to "merchant's favor" - special items (healing potions, better weapons) at reduced cost.
- **Injury:** PC who took most hits from raiders gains "Scarred Guardian" title; crowd remembers their sacrifice.
