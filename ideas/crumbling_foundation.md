# Crumbling Foundation

- **Hook:** "The floor falls away!" The arena floor is a network of stone tiles suspended over a bottomless pit. Tiles collapse randomly each round, forcing gladiators to constantly reposition or plummet to their doom. The crowd gasps as footing betrays and combatants scramble across shrinking ground.
- **Party:** 4-6 PCs, level 5+. Emphasizes tactical positioning, jump mechanics, and adaptability under unstable conditions.

## Arena Layout
- 100-foot × 100-foot grid of stone tiles (10-foot squares, 100 tiles total).
- **Tile Stability:** Each tile has durability: Stable (green), Cracking (yellow), Collapsing (red).
- **The Pit:** Bottomless chasm beneath tiles; fall = death (instant elimination, no save, body never recovered).
- **Starting Tiles:** Central 6×6 section (36 tiles) starts Stable. Outer tiles already Cracking.

## Collapse Mechanic
- **Initiative Count 20:** Roll 2d10 to determine which tiles crack or collapse.
  - GM uses grid coordinates (e.g., "E-7" cracks, "H-3" collapses).
  - Alternatively, roll randomly for dramatic unpredictability.
- **Tile Progression:**
  - **Stable (green)** → **Cracking (yellow)** after 1 trigger.
  - **Cracking (yellow)** → **Collapsing (red)** after 1 more trigger.
  - **Collapsing (red)** → Falls away next trigger; creatures on it fall.
- **Weight Limit:** Cracking tiles can hold 2 Medium creatures safely. Third creature triggers immediate collapse (Dex save DC 14 to jump to adjacent tile or fall).
- **Jumping:** Moving to adjacent tile costs normal movement (5 feet). Jumping across gaps (diagonal, or to non-adjacent tiles) requires Athletics check:
  - DC 10: Jump to diagonal adjacent tile (10-foot distance).
  - DC 13: Jump 15 feet (one tile gap).
  - DC 16: Jump 20 feet (two tile gap).
  - Failure = fall into pit.

## Tile State Tracking
- GM tracks tile states visually (colored tokens, battle map colors, or grid notes).
- PCs can assess tile stability with Perception check DC 10 (action) to identify Cracking vs. Stable within 30 feet.
- Some tiles have visible cracks; others betray with no warning (dramatic tension).

## Enemies (agile ambushers)
- 3 Hook Horrors (CR 3 each; climb speed ignores tile stability, hooking attacks pull PCs off balance).
- 2 Umber Hulks (CR 5 each; burrow ability lets them surface on any tile, confusing gaze causes chaos).
- 4 Giant Spiders (CR 1 each; web attacks restrain PCs on Cracking tiles—death trap combo).
- 1 Roper (CR 5; anchored to wall above pit, tendrils grab PCs and pull them off tiles).
- **Flex:** For 4 PCs, remove 1 Hook Horror and the Roper. For 6 PCs, add 2 more Giant Spiders and 1 Carrion Crawler.

## Enemy Tactics
- **Hook Horrors:** Climb walls and attack from unexpected angles; hook attacks pull PCs toward pit edges.
- **Umber Hulks:** Burrow beneath tiles, surface on Collapsing tiles to destabilize further; confusing gaze forces PCs to move unpredictably (potentially onto bad tiles).
- **Giant Spiders:** Web PCs onto Cracking tiles, then focus fire to trigger collapse from weight; climb to safety when tiles fall.
- **Roper:** Tendrils grapple PCs (reach 50 feet), reeling them toward pit edge; targets PCs on isolated Stable tiles.

## Crowd Favor Hooks
- Successfully jump across a 2-tile gap (20 feet) mid-combat: +2 [[crowds_favor_mechanic|Favor]].
- Save an ally from falling (reaction grapple, DC 15 Strength/Dex): +2 Favor for heroism.
- Defeat an enemy by collapsing the tile beneath them: +2 Favor for environmental mastery.
- Survive standing on a Collapsing tile when it falls (by jumping away as reaction): +1 Favor for reflexes.
- Never step on a Cracking or Collapsing tile throughout the fight: +3 Favor for perfect positioning.
- Kill the Roper while grappled by its tendrils: +2 Favor for defiance.

## Hazards and Environment
- **Tile Collapse:** Constant threat; positioning is life-or-death.
- **Weight Triggers:** Grouping up on Cracking tiles = disaster; forces PCs to spread out.
- **Grapple Danger:** Being grappled on Collapsing tile = likely fall (Roper tendrils, Hook Horror hooks).
- **Web Restraint:** Giant Spider webs trap PCs on doomed tiles; must break free (Strength DC 12) or cut web (AC 10, 5 HP) before tile falls.
- **Umber Hulk Confusion:** Confusing gaze (Charisma save DC 15) forces random movement—could step onto Collapsing tile involuntarily.

## Announcer Beats
- Opening: "THE FLOOR FALLS AWAY! Each step could be your LAST! Balance, gladiators, or FALL FOREVER!"
- First collapse: "TILE C-4 CRUMBLES! The gladiator leaps—JUST IN TIME! The crowd holds its breath!"
- PC falls: "INTO THE ABYSS! We will never see them again! The pit claims another!"
- Enemy falls: "The Umber Hulk—TOO HEAVY! Its own weight betrays! Down it goes!"
- Heroic save: "She catches him! One hand on the ledge! PULL, PULL, PULL!"
- Desperate scramble: "Only a dozen tiles remain! They huddle on shrinking ground! WHERE CAN THEY GO?!"
- Victory: "Survivors stand on the last stable ground! The pit has been denied! Tarsus ROARS!"

## GM Tips
- Pre-mark which tiles will collapse in advance (for pacing) or roll randomly for chaos—both work.
- Use physical grid or digital map with color coding; players must see tile states clearly.
- Announce collapses dramatically: "You hear grinding stone beneath your feet!"
- Give PCs 1 free Perception check at start to assess nearby tiles (teaches mechanic).
- Enemies should exploit chaos—Umber Hulks surface on weak tiles, Spiders web PCs onto Cracking tiles.
- If PC falls, describe the crowd's reaction: stunned silence, then roar of shock.
- Let creative solutions earn Favor: *mage hand* to test tiles, *feather fall* to survive, *misty step* to safety.
- Consider giving PCs warning signs: tile shudders before collapse (1 round notice, reaction to jump away).

## Aftermath Seeds
- Patron interest: Structural engineer impressed by "architectural awareness"; offers job sabotaging rival arenas (risky, pays well).
- Rumor: Bodies fall into underground river system—survivors in the darkness? Escaped gladiators plotting revenge?
- Downtime: Hook Horror hooks can be harvested (crafted into grappling hooks with +2 to Athletics checks for climbing, smith required, 50 gp cost).
- Injury: PC who fell and was saved develops "Fear of Heights"—disadvantage on saves vs. falling, roleplaying hesitation near edges.
- Political: Arena maintenance crew blamed for tile collapses—investigation reveals sabotage by rival faction.
- Reward: Roper tendrils (can be sold for 150 gp or crafted into *rope of entanglement* by skilled leatherworker).
