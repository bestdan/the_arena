# The Assassin's Masquerade

- **Hook:** "TEN ENTER! FIVE ARE TRUE! FIVE ARE FALSE!" The arena floods with smoke and magical disguises as five Faceless Assassins take on the EXACT appearance of the PCs. Allies and enemies look identical. Damage reveals truth—bloodied combatants' disguises flicker. Can they identify imposters through combat, coordination codes, and behavioral tells before the assassins eliminate them—or worse, make them eliminate each other?
- **Party:** 4-5 PCs. Tests trust, communication, pattern recognition, and restraint. Ultimate paranoia scenario where every "ally" might be an assassin. Players must develop verification methods while fighting blind.

## Arena Layout

- Square arena (80 feet × 80 feet) with thick smoke filling the space (lightly obscured—disadvantage on Perception checks relying on sight).
- **Four Pillars:** Positioned at corners (15 feet tall, 5 feet diameter, climbable DC 10, provide full cover).
- **Central Fountain:** 20-foot-diameter ornate fountain (dry, provides half-cover, makes noise if disturbed—splash alerts everyone).
- **Six Alcoves:** Small recesses in walls (10 feet deep, 5 feet wide), provide hiding spots but can trap PCs (DC 12 Athletics to escape if enemy blocks entrance).
- **Mirror Walls:** Two walls have polished surfaces (south and west walls)—reflections visible but distorted by smoke.
- **Smoke:** Magical mist persists entire combat (can't be dispelled); reduces visibility to 40 feet clearly, beyond that heavily obscured.

## The Disguise Mechanic (CORE CHALLENGE)

**Five Faceless Assassins:**
- Each assassin uses *disguise self* (permanent, powerful version) to perfectly mimic one PC's appearance, voice, and mannerisms.
- **Indistinguishable by sight:** All skill checks to identify imposters by appearance fail until disguise is damaged.
- **Behavioral tells only:** PCs must identify assassins through:
  - Combat tactics (assassins fight differently).
  - Knowledge questions (assassins don't know party history).
  - Coordination codes (PCs can create passwords/signals).
  - Damage reveals (bloodied assassins' disguises flicker—see below).

**Damage-Reveal Rule:**
- When assassin takes 20+ damage total, disguise flickers briefly (1 round): face ripples, true features visible underneath (blank faceless humanoid).
- After 40+ damage, disguise fails permanently—assassin revealed.
- PCs can strategically damage "allies" to verify identity (risky—might be real ally).

**Assassin Behavior:**
- Assassins TRY to act like PCs but make subtle mistakes:
  - Wrong combat tactics (rogue imposter uses longsword when real rogue uses daggers).
  - Wrong spell choices (wizard imposter casts *fireball* when real wizard prefers *ice storm*).
  - Failed history checks (DM asks imposter player: "What did we do last session?" Imposter doesn't know).
  - Mechanical tells (assassin stats differ from PC stats—see below).

## Assassin Statistics

**Faceless Assassin (CR 4 each):**
- **AC:** 15 (leather armor + Dexterity)
- **HP:** 60 (lower than most PCs at level 5-7)
- **Speed:** 30 feet
- **Abilities:** Str 12, Dex 18, Con 14, Int 10, Wis 12, Cha 8
- **Skills:** Stealth +7, Deception +2, Perception +4
- **Attacks:**
  - **Multiattack:** Two dagger attacks.
  - **Dagger:** +7 to hit, 1d4+4 piercing + 2d6 poison (DC 14 Con save or poisoned for 1 minute).
  - **Sneak Attack:** Once per turn, if advantage or ally within 5 feet of target, add 3d6 damage.
- **Special Abilities:**
  - **Disguise Self (Permanent):** Mimics PC appearance perfectly until dispelled or assassin takes 40+ damage.
  - **Assassinate:** If surprises a creature, attacks have advantage and all hits are critical (first round only).
  - **Evasion:** Dex saves for half damage—takes no damage on success.
- **Tactics:** Hit-and-run, poison attacks, create chaos, impersonate allies to get close, accuse real PCs of being imposters.

**Mechanical Tells:**
- Assassins have DIFFERENT stats than PCs—observant players notice:
  - Imposter wizard casts spells without material components (assassins don't have real spell slots, use innate abilities).
  - Imposter fighter has lower HP (60 vs. PC's 70+).
  - Imposter rogue moves at 30 feet (vs. PC rogue's 35 feet with Fast Movement feature).
- DM should narrate these subtly: "You see the 'fighter' take a hit and... they seem to shrug it off easier than usual?"

## Objectives

- **Primary:** Eliminate all 5 Faceless Assassins without killing any real PCs.
- **Secondary:** Identify all assassins before any PC drops to 0 HP (paranoia shouldn't paralyze them).
- **Bonus:** Capture at least 1 assassin alive (reduce to 0 HP with non-lethal damage) for interrogation afterward.

## Trust and Verification Mechanics

**Pre-Combat Preparation:**
- PCs can establish codes BEFORE combat starts (if they anticipate betrayal):
  - Password phrases: "What did we eat at tavern?" "Roast mutton."
  - Secret signals: Hand gestures, specific movement patterns.
  - Spell identifiers: Real wizard casts *prestidigitation* to create unique light color.

**Mid-Combat Verification:**
- **Knowledge Checks:** Ask "ally" about shared experiences: "What's our mission?" "Who hired us?"
- **Skill Demonstrations:** "Cast your signature spell!" "Show me your barbarian rage!"
- **Damage Testing:** Deliberately attack "ally" lightly (5-10 damage) to see if disguise flickers.
- **Behavioral Analysis:** Watch how "ally" fights—do they use correct weapons, tactics, spells?

**Paranoia Escalation:**
- Early rounds: Everyone trusts everyone, chaos ensues.
- Mid-combat: Suspicions rise, accusations fly, paranoia peaks.
- Late combat: Most assassins revealed, remaining ones become obvious.

## Enemy Tactics (Assassin Strategy)

**Sow Chaos:**
- Assassins accuse real PCs of being imposters: "That's not the real fighter! Look, they're using wrong stance!"
- Attack real PCs while yelling for help: "Help! This imposter is attacking me!"
- Use poison to weaken real PCs, making them easier to finish later.

**Exploit Trust:**
- Imposter cleric refuses to heal "suspicious" ally (real PC), claims they're imposter.
- Imposter rogue "scouts" alone (separates from group, assassinates isolated PC).
- Imposter wizard "casts AoE spell" but intentionally hits real PCs, claims "accident."

**Hit-and-Run:**
- Assassins don't stand and fight—dart in, sneak attack, retreat into smoke.
- Use pillars and alcoves for cover, force PCs to chase.
- If bloodied (disguise flickering), flee to regroup with other assassins.

**Endgame Desperation:**
- When only 1-2 assassins remain, they surrender or attempt hostage-taking (grapple real PC, threaten to kill).

## Crowd Favor Hooks

- Correctly identify an assassin through behavioral tell (no damage): +2 [[crowds_favor|Favor]] for deduction.
- Establish and successfully use verification code 3+ times: +2 Favor for preparation.
- Damage-test an ally, confirm they're real, apologize: +1 Favor for caution and honor.
- Catch assassin in a lie (failed knowledge check): +1 Favor for awareness.
- Resist assassin's poison 3+ times: +1 Favor for resilience.
- Entire team survives without accidentally killing real PC: +4 Favor for discipline.
- Capture assassin alive (non-lethal): +2 Favor per captured assassin.
- [[panache|Panache]] dramatically reveal assassin ("I knew you were fake when you said X!"): +3 Favor for showmanship.
- Final assassin defeated while impersonating a PC (crowd gasps as disguise drops): +2 Favor for dramatic irony.

## Interrogation Opportunity

**If Assassin Captured Alive:**
- Can be questioned after combat (Intimidation DC 14 or Persuasion DC 16).
- Reveals: "We were hired by [rival gladiator group / political enemy / crime syndicate] to eliminate you."
- **Patron Hook:** Information leads to downtime investigation subplot—who wanted PCs dead?

## Announcer Beats

- Opening: "TEN WARRIORS! But five are LIES! Can they trust their eyes—or their STEEL?!"
- First attack: "Ally strikes ally! Or is it?! CHAOS REIGNS!"
- First disguise flicker: "BLOOD REVEALS! The disguise FAILS! An imposter EXPOSED!"
- Accusation moment: "They accuse each other! WHO IS TRUE?! The crowd holds its breath!"
- Wrong target attacked: "NO! Ally wounds ally! The assassins LAUGH in shadow!"
- First assassin killed: "ONE IMPOSTER FALLS! Its true face revealed—FACELESS! Four remain!"
- Near-death save: "The real champion barely stands! Can their allies recognize them in time?!"
- Victory: "THE LAST IMPOSTER FALLS! Truth triumphs over deception! THEY SURVIVED THE MASQUERADE!"
- Tragedy (if PC dies): "A true champion falls to false faces! The assassins claim their price!"

## GM Tips

**Player Management:**
- **Secret Communication:** Assassins are played by GM, but PCs don't know who is who initially—describe all 10 combatants neutrally.
- **DM Speaks for Assassins:** When imposter acts, describe actions without revealing identity: "The fighter-looking one moves forward and attacks."
- **Behavioral Clues:** Drop subtle hints in narration:
  - "The rogue moves toward you... but their gait seems slightly off?"
  - "The wizard casts *fire bolt*... but you don't see them using a component pouch?"
- **Don't Punish Paranoia:** If PCs test allies with light damage, don't make them feel bad—it's smart play.
- **Damage Tracking:** Clearly track damage on each combatant (assassins hidden, PCs visible)—reveal flickers at 20+ and 40+ thresholds.
- **Poison Effects:** When PC poisoned, describe symptoms dramatically: "Your vision blurs, stomach turns—something's WRONG."

**Pacing:**
- **Round 1-3:** Confusion and chaos—everyone looks identical.
- **Round 4-6:** First reveals happen (damage thresholds hit), suspicions confirmed.
- **Round 7+:** Most assassins identified, final confrontations occur.

**Communication Emphasis:**
- Encourage players to TALK in-character: "Prove you're really you! Tell me something only you'd know!"
- Reward creative verification methods (unique spells, shared memories, tactical knowledge).

## Tactical Elements

- **AoE Risk:** Fireball or similar spells hit both real allies and assassins—high risk/reward.
- **Healing Dilemma:** Does healer heal "ally" who might be assassin (wasting resources)?
- **Positioning Games:** Assassins try to maneuver real PCs into vulnerable positions (separated, surrounded).
- **Smoke Advantage:** Assassins use concealment to escape after sneak attacks, reposition.
- **Verification Costs Actions:** Testing allies with knowledge questions or damage costs time—assassins attack while PCs debate.

## Aftermath Seeds

- **Paranoia Trait:** PC who accidentally attacked real ally develops trust issues (disadvantage on Insight checks vs. party members for 1 week—then therapy helps).
- **Patron Interest:** Assassins' employer revealed through interrogation—leads to revenge subplot or rival gladiator faction war.
- **Rumor:** Faceless Assassins are elite guild operating in Tarsus underbelly—PCs now on their radar (marked for future attempts).
- **Downtime:** Captured assassin's mask can be kept—functions as *disguise self* (1/day, 1 hour duration, requires attunement).
- **Injury:** PC who took assassin poison damage develops brief paranoia hallucinations (sees faces morphing for 2 days, cosmetic, unsettling).
- **Legendary Moment:** If no PCs accidentally harmed and all assassins identified quickly (by Round 6), crowd chants "TRUTH SEEKERS!"—gain reputation as "Undeceivable" (+2 Insight checks for 1 month).
- **Political:** Arena leaked info to assassins (insider threat)—PCs must investigate staff betrayal, uncover spy.
- **Loot:** Each assassin drops 50 gp, poisoned daggers (10 doses of wyvern poison, DC 14 Con save or 7d6 poison), and one *potion of invisibility*.
- **Trust Reinforced:** PCs who successfully verified each other without harm strengthen bonds—advantage on next collaborative skill check (one-time bonus representing teamwork understanding).
