# Giants and Mice

- **Hook:** Wild transmutation magic warps reality—half the gladiators grow to giant size while the others shrink to mouse proportions. Giants can smash obstacles and enemies but are slow and clumsy. Mice can slip through cracks and trigger mechanisms but are fragile. Both must work together to survive enemies designed to exploit their weaknesses. The crowd roars at the absurdity made deadly.
- **Party:** 4-6 PCs. Half become Giants (size Huge), half become Mice (size Tiny). Asymmetric abilities force cooperation.

## Arena Layout
- Multi-tiered complex: ground level (80×80 feet), elevated platforms (20 feet high), and miniature tunnels/vents accessible only to Mice.
- Giant-scale obstacles: massive stone blocks (require Giants to push), heavy gates (Giants lift, Mice slip under to unlock from inside).
- Mouse-scale passages: air ducts, wall cracks, gear mechanisms (only Mice fit, lead to crucial levers and valves).
- Central puzzle: Giant-side has three heavy chains; Mouse-side has three tiny gears. All must be operated simultaneously to lower enemy reinforcement cage.

## Size Transformation Rules
**Giants (Huge Size):**
- Reach increases by 5 feet.
- Advantage on Strength checks and saves.
- Disadvantage on Dexterity saves.
- Speed reduced by 10 feet (cumbersome).
- Deal +1d6 damage on melee attacks (raw power).
- Can push/grapple Large or smaller creatures with advantage.
- Cannot fit through standard doors or passages; must break through (Athletics DC varies).
- Provide cover for Mouse-sized allies (Mouse can hide/move under Giant without penalty).

**Mice (Tiny Size):**
- Speed increased by 10 feet (darting movement).
- Advantage on Dexterity saves and Stealth checks.
- Disadvantage on Strength checks.
- Damage reduced: deal -1d4 damage on attacks (max 1 damage).
- Can fit through 1-inch gaps (wall cracks, keyholes, vents).
- Can occupy another creature's space (including allies).
- Enemy AoE attacks auto-miss if Mouse is currently hiding under/on a Giant (Giant takes the damage instead).
- Can ride on Giant allies (move with them, take actions from their shoulder/back).

## Enemies (size exploiters)
**Giant-Hunters:**
- 3 Ballista Snipers (use Scouts with heavy crossbows, CR 1; focus fire on Giants, ignore Mice).
- 1 Chain Devil (CR 8; attempts to grapple and restrain Giants with chains, Dex save DC 14).
- 2 Earth Elementals (CR 5; slam attacks vs. Giants, tremorsense detects Mice easily).

**Mouse-Hunters:**
- 4 Swarms of Rats (CR 1/4; specifically target Mice, overwhelm with numbers).
- 2 Hunting Cats (reskin Displacer Beasts, CR 3; pounce on Mice, use displacement to avoid Giant attacks).
- 1 Mousetrap Construct (custom, CR 4; mechanical predator that sets spring-loaded traps in Mouse passages, deals 4d6 damage on failed Dex DC 15).

**Flex:** For 4 PCs (2 Giants, 2 Mice), remove 1 Earth Elemental and 1 Ballista Sniper. For 6 PCs (3 Giants, 3 Mice), add 1 more Chain Devil and upgrade Swarms to Giant Rats (individual CR 1/8 enemies, 6 total).

## Cooperation Mechanics (Mandatory)
**Obstacle Examples:**
- Heavy portcullis blocks path; Giant must lift while Mouse slips under to disable locking mechanism from other side.
- Massive stone blocks form maze; Giant pushes blocks to create paths while Mouse scouts ahead through wall cracks to call out safe routes.
- Pressure plates require Giant weight to activate; Mouse must run through exposed killzone to pull lever before plate releases.
- Enemy reinforcement cage: Giants pull chains while Mice turn gears simultaneously; requires perfect timing (initiative count 20, all must act together).

**Combat Synergies:**
- **Pocket Tank:** Mouse rides on Giant's shoulder; Giant provides mobile cover, Mouse shoots from height advantage.
- **Distraction Play:** Mouse darts at enemy's feet (Help action, advantage for Giant's next attack); enemy looks down, Giant strikes from above.
- **Leverage Strike:** Giant grapples Large enemy, holds it prone; Mouse attacks vulnerable spot (exposed underbelly, neck) with advantage and auto-crit if hit.
- **Hazard Relay:** Mouse triggers mechanism (opens trapdoor, activates ceiling trap); Giant shoves enemy into the hazard.

## Objectives
- **Primary:** Defeat all enemies using size-appropriate tactics.
- **Secondary:** Lower the reinforcement cage before Round 8 (prevents additional enemies).
- **Bonus:** Complete fight with no Giant reduced below half HP and no Mouse falling unconscious.

## Crowd Favor Hooks
- Giant provides cover that saves Mouse from AoE attack: +2 [[crowds_favor|Favor]] to Giant.
- Mouse unlocks mechanism that frees trapped Giant: +2 Favor to Mouse.
- Giant grapples enemy while Mouse delivers killing blow to vulnerable spot: +2 Favor to both.
- Mouse rides Giant into combat and executes synchronized [[panache|Panache]] strike from shoulder: +3 Favor split.
- Successfully operate reinforcement cage puzzle (all chains/gears together): +1 Favor to all participants.
- Giant throws Mouse across chasm to reach distant lever: +2 Favor for trust fall (requires Athletics check).
- Mouse uses Stealth to scout enemy position and relay perfect tactical info to Giant: +1 Favor.
- Giant blocks doorway while Mice swarm through to disable threat from behind: +2 Favor to Giant for sacrifice defense.

## Size-Specific Hazards
**For Giants:**
- Low ceilings (15 feet): Giants must crouch (half speed, disadvantage on attacks while crouched).
- Fragile walkways: weight limits; Giant stepping on causes collapse (Dex DC 13 or fall 20 feet, 2d6 damage).
- Ballista traps triggered by Giant-scale pressure plates (auto-fire when stepped on, +7 to hit, 3d10 damage).

**For Mice:**
- Sticky glue patches (Mouse must make DC 12 Strength check to escape or be restrained).
- Mousetraps in passages: Perception DC 14 to spot, Dex DC 15 to avoid, 4d6 damage and restrained on failure.
- Flooding vents: water rushes through Mouse tunnels on initiative count 15 every 3 rounds; Mouse must make DC 13 Strength save or be swept 20 feet and take 1d6 damage.

## Announcer Beats
- Opening: "BEHOLD! Magic twists our champions into GIANTS and MICE! The mighty stumble! The small skitter! Can opposites unite?!"
- First cooperation: "The Giant lifts! The Mouse dashes! TEAMWORK INCARNATE!"
- Giant covers Mouse from AoE: "A living shield! The colossus protects the mite!"
- Mouse unlocks mechanism: "Tiny paws, MASSIVE impact! The lock yields!"
- Reinforcement cage lowered: "SYNCHRONIZED! Chains and gears as ONE! The cage seals shut!"
- Giant grapples, Mouse critical strikes: "The titan holds! The vermin STRIKES! Death comes in all sizes!"
- Victory: "Size matters NOT when hearts beat as ONE! Giants and Mice—TRIUMPHANT!"

## GM Tips
- Clearly label which PCs are Giants vs. Mice; use larger/smaller tokens or minis.
- Encourage voice coordination: "I'll hold this gate—you run through and unlock it from inside!"
- Describe scale differences vividly: "The Mouse PC is literally the size of the Giant's thumb."
- Let Giants feel powerful but clumsy; Mice feel fragile but clever.
- Enemies should target size-appropriate threats: Giant-hunters ignore Mice, Mouse-hunters ignore Giants.
- Obstacles REQUIRE both sizes; no solo solutions allowed (enforce cooperation).
- Track reinforcement cage timer visibly; creates urgency for teamwork.
- Allow creative size exploitation: Giants throw Mice, Mice hide in Giant's pockets, etc.
- If teams struggle, let announcer drop hints: "Perhaps the small one could reach that lever?"
- Emphasize the comedy AND danger: absurd situations with deadly stakes.

## Aftermath Seeds
- **Size Dysphoria:** PCs occasionally feel phantom size changes for days after (purely narrative).
- **Patron Interest:** Transmutation wizard offers sponsorship; wants to study sustained size magic effects on gladiators.
- **Rumor:** The size magic was accidental—spellcaster in crowd lost control. Investigation reveals sabotage attempt.
- **Injury:** PC who spent session as Giant develops minor "Enlarged Echo": occasionally bumps head on doorframes out of habit (cosmetic).
- **Political:** Crowd demands more size-shifting spectacles; arena masters begin researching permanent transformation arenas.
- **Downtime:** Size-coordination training available; Giants and Mice can practice teamwork for bonuses in future asymmetric scenarios.
- **Legendary Moment:** If team executed flawless reinforcement cage puzzle, crowd commissions commemorative artwork: "Giants and Mice United Against the Impossible."
- **Equipment Damage:** Gear worn during transformation is magically restored after battle, but one random item per PC gains minor cosmetic flaw (stretched seams, tiny cracks).
