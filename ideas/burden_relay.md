# The Burden Shared

- **Hook:** Ancient gladiatorial tradition returns—champions must carry the Burden Stone across a gauntlet while enemies swarm. The Shard is impossibly heavy; only two can bear it at once, and they cannot fight while carrying. The others must defend. Every 3 rounds, bearers MUST swap or collapse from exhaustion. The crowd watches the desperate choreography—can they pass the burden without dropping it?
- **Party:** 4-6 PCs must work as rotating pairs. Two carry, others defend. Coordination and timing determine survival.

## Arena Layout
- 120-foot-long gauntlet course (20 feet wide) from West Gate to East Gate.
- Divided into three zones: Starting Grounds (40 feet), Killing Field (40 feet, heavy enemy presence), Final Stretch (40 feet, hazards and obstacles).
- Scattered obstacles: barricades (provide cover, slow movement), spike pits (10-foot squares, DC 13 Dex or 2d6 damage), and collapsing platforms (Athletics DC 12 to cross before falling).
- No safe zones; enemies spawn continuously from side tunnels.

## The Burden Stone (Core Mechanic)
**Carrying Requirements:**
- Requires EXACTLY 2 PCs carrying simultaneously (each using both hands).
- Carriers cannot make attacks, cast spells with somatic components, or use items.
- Carriers can move but speed reduced by half (shared movement; both must coordinate).
- Carriers can make Strength (Athletics) checks, shove, or dodge.
- If only 1 PC attempts to carry alone: auto-failure, Shard drops, combat pauses while they scramble to lift it (loses 1 round).

**Exhaustion Timer:**
- Every 3 rounds, current carriers must make DC 14 Constitution save.
- On failure: gain 1 level of exhaustion, disadvantage on all checks/attacks.
- On second failure (6 rounds carrying): auto-drop the Shard, take 1d6 damage from strain.
- **Mandatory Swap:** Carriers MUST swap with fresh PCs every 3 rounds to avoid exhaustion death spiral.

**Shard Properties:**
- If dropped during swap: Shard cracks (loud noise), enemy reinforcements arrive (additional wave spawns).
- If Shard crosses into enemy square: enemies attack Shard directly (AC 18, 50 HP; if reduced to 0, Shard shatters—immediate defeat).
- Shard glows brighter as it nears East Gate; cosmetic but builds tension.

## Swap Mechanics (Critical Cooperation)
- Swapping carriers requires 1 full round where all 4 (or 6) PCs are within 10 feet of Shard.
- During swap, BOTH old and new carriers use their action to transfer (cannot attack that round).
- Defenders must create "swap window"—clear 10-foot radius of enemies for safe handoff.
- Announce swaps clearly: "We're swapping on initiative count 15—COVER US!"

## Enemies (relentless pursuit)
**Continuous Waves (spawn every 2 rounds):**
- Rounds 1-2: 4 Bandits (CR 1/8) rush from side tunnels.
- Rounds 3-4: 3 Thugs (CR 1/2) + 2 Scouts (CR 1/2; Cunning Action to harass carriers).
- Rounds 5-6: 2 Veterans (CR 3) + 1 Priest (CR 2; casts *hold person* on defenders).
- Rounds 7-8: 1 Assassin (CR 8; targets carriers specifically, uses poison).
- Rounds 9+: 2 Berserkers (CR 2) every round until completion or defeat.

**Enemy Tactics:**
- Priority 1: Attack the Shard (break it, win instantly).
- Priority 2: Grapple/restrain carriers (slow progress).
- Priority 3: Kill defenders (leave carriers vulnerable).
- Enemies use readied actions to attack during swaps (punish poor timing).

**Flex:** For 4 PCs, reduce each wave by 1-2 enemies. For 6 PCs, add 1 Ogre (CR 2) to Wave 3 and 1 Mage (CR 6) to Wave 4.

## Zone Hazards
**Starting Grounds (0-40 feet):**
- Barricades provide half-cover but slow movement (difficult terrain).
- Relatively safe; enemies focus on probing attacks.

**Killing Field (40-80 feet):**
- Two spike pits (10×10 feet each); Perception DC 13 to spot, Dex DC 13 to avoid, 2d6 damage + restrained.
- Enemy archers on elevated positions (15 feet high); +2 to hit vs. carriers.
- Swirling sand (difficult terrain); disadvantage on Perception checks.

**Final Stretch (80-120 feet):**
- Collapsing bridge platforms: carriers must make DC 12 Athletics check each 10 feet or platform drops (10-foot fall, 1d6 damage).
- Final gate locked: defender must use action to unlock while carriers wait (Thieves' Tools DC 13 or Athletics DC 15 to force).
- Enemy ambush: 4 Goblins (CR 1/4) drop from ceiling when carriers enter this zone.

## Objectives
- **Primary:** Carry Burden Stone from West Gate to East Gate (120 feet) without shattering.
- **Secondary:** Complete relay with no carrier gaining more than 1 exhaustion level.
- **Bonus:** Execute 2+ clean swaps (no damage taken during swap round) (+2 [[crowds_favor|Favor]] to team).

## Crowd Favor Hooks
- Execute perfect swap with no enemies within 10 feet: +1 Favor to all participants.
- Carrier survives grapple attempt and breaks free same round: +2 Favor.
- Defender kills enemy targeting Shard before it can attack: +3 Favor for clutch save.
- Complete Killing Field zone with Shard at full HP: +2 Favor to all.
- Carrier [[panache|Panache]]-shoves enemy into spike pit while carrying: +3 Favor for style under duress.
- All defenders coordinate to create swap window under heavy fire: +2 Favor split.
- Cross Final Stretch without failing any Athletics checks: +1 Favor to carriers.
- Defeat Assassin before it reaches carriers: +2 Favor to killer.

## Relay Roles
**Carriers:**
- Navigate obstacles, call out hazards to teammates.
- Coordinate movement: "Left! Dodge the pit!"
- Make swap timing decisions: "We swap at count 15—get ready!"

**Defenders:**
- Engage enemies aggressively to prevent Shard attacks.
- Create perimeter during swaps: "I've got north side! Cover south!"
- Unlock gates, clear hazards, provide healing/buffs to carriers.

## Announcer Beats
- Opening: "The Burden Shared! An ancient test of unity! Carry or collapse—there is NO middle ground!"
- First swap: "The exchange! Smooth as silk! Can they maintain this pace?!"
- Enemy targets Shard: "They strike the crystal! Protect the relic!"
- Exhaustion failure: "Strain takes its toll! The bearer FALTERS! Can they recover?!"
- Killing Field entry: "Into the gauntlet's heart! Death waits at every step!"
- Final Stretch: "The gate is IN SIGHT! One last push!"
- Victory: "THE SHARD CROSSES! Unity conquers adversity! The relay STANDS COMPLETE!"

## GM Tips
- Track carrier rotations publicly on a timer or index cards; builds visible tension.
- Remind carriers of exhaustion saves every 3 rounds; this is non-negotiable.
- Enemies WILL attack the Shard; narrate vividly: "The blade bites into crystal—HP down to 38!"
- Encourage team voice communication: "Swap in 5... 4... 3... NOW!"
- Let defenders feel heroic protecting vulnerable carriers; spotlight their sacrifices.
- Use spawn waves to maintain pressure but allow brief respites for swaps.
- If team struggles, let announcer "accidentally" slow enemy wave (delay 1 round) via crowd distraction.
- Track progress visually: mark zones on map, celebrate milestones (40 feet, 80 feet, etc.).
- Emphasize carrier helplessness; they can't fight back, only endure and trust teammates.

## Aftermath Seeds
- **Burden Bearers:** Carriers develop subtle muscle strain injuries; cosmetic reminders of the weight borne.
- **Patron Interest:** Military commander impressed by relay coordination; offers contract to transport precious cargo through hostile territory (dangerous, lucrative).
- **Rumor:** The Burden Stone was fragment of ancient prison obelisk; its destination (East Gate) was a ritual circle. What were they really transporting?
- **Legendary Moment:** If team completed with 0 exhaustion and Shard at full HP, crowd commissions relay sculpture: two figures bearing crystal, surrounded by defenders.
- **Political:** Arena masters plan to make Burden Shared a regular event; rival teams begin training specifically for it.
- **Downtime:** Relay endurance training available; carriers can build resistance to exhaustion in future burden scenarios.
- **Equipment:** PCs can commission "Carrier's Harness" (expensive, 100gp): grants +2 to Con saves while carrying heavy objects.
- **Injury:** Defender who saved Shard from destruction develops "Guardian's Instinct": minor PTSD-like hyper-vigilance around fragile objects.
