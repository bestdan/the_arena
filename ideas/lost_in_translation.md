# Lost in Translation

- **Hook:** Arcane interference scrambles all language. Each gladiator hears the others speak gibberish—but scattered across the arena are clues in *different languages*. Decode the escape route while enemies harry you. Fail, and the sands swallow you whole.
- **Party:** 4-6 PCs, level 3+. Emphasize puzzle-solving, creative communication, and resource management under pressure.

## Arena Layout
- Circular arena (100-foot diameter) with **five stations** arranged in a pentagram pattern (each 30 feet from center).
- Each station has a **Clue Pedestal** (stone lectern) with inscriptions in a different language.
- Center contains the **Exit Seal**—massive locked stone door etched with arcane symbols (requires correct sequence to open).
- Terrain: low stone walls (3-4 feet, half cover), scattered rubble (difficult terrain), arcane runes glowing faintly on floor (harmless but distracting).
- Crowd watches from above; they hear normally but gladiators suffer the curse.

## Core Mechanic: Language Scramble Curse
At the start of the bout, arcane wards activate:
- All PCs lose the ability to **speak or understand any common language** they share (Common, Elvish, Dwarvish, etc. are scrambled into incomprehensible noise).
- PCs retain **one language each** that they alone understand (assign based on PC backgrounds; if PC knows multiple, let player choose one).
- Examples: Fighter knows only Orcish; Wizard knows only Draconic; Rogue knows only Thieves' Cant; Cleric knows only Celestial.
- **Written language is also scrambled**—except for the clues at pedestals (each clue is written in *one specific language*).

### The Clues
Each of the five Clue Pedestals has an inscription in a **different language**:
1. **North Pedestal:** Draconic — "First, the flame must ignite."
2. **East Pedestal:** Celestial — "Second, the blade points skyward."
3. **South Pedestal:** Infernal — "Third, the water flows downward."
4. **West Pedestal:** Sylvan — "Fourth, the stone touches earth."
5. **Center Pedestal:** Giant — "Fifth, the crown rests upon the seal."

Each clue describes one step of a five-step sequence to unlock the **Exit Seal**.

### Unlocking the Exit Seal
The Exit Seal has five **arcane symbols** arranged around it (flame, blade, water, stone, crown).
- PCs must activate the symbols **in the correct order** (as dictated by the clues: flame → blade → water → stone → crown).
- Activating a symbol requires touching it and declaring the activation aloud (any language works; it's the order that matters).
- **Incorrect order:** The seal resets; all activated symbols deactivate; 2d6 force damage to all PCs within 10 feet of seal.
- **Correct order:** The seal glows, door opens; PCs can exit and win.

### Communication Challenge
PCs must:
1. Visit all five pedestals and **read the clues** (only PCs who know the language can read it).
2. **Communicate the clues to each other**—but they can't speak a shared language.
3. Use **gestures, drawings in sand, pantomime, or creative methods** to convey meaning.
4. Deduce the **correct sequence** and activate symbols in order.

## Enemies (The Harassers)
Enemies exist to create pressure and force PCs to split attention; they **do not stop the puzzle directly** but make solving it harder.

### 4 PCs
- 3 **Arcane Sentinels** (reskin Animated Armor, CR 1; immune to language curse; patrol arena, attack PCs who linger at pedestals).
- 2 **Spell Scramblers** (reskin Imp, CR 1; cast *minor illusion* to create fake clues or obscure real ones; use *invisibility* to sneak around).

### 5 PCs
- 4 Arcane Sentinels.
- 3 Spell Scramblers.
- Add 1 **Silence Wraith** (use Shadow, CR 1/2; casts *silence* centered on itself once per encounter; forces PCs to solve puzzle without verbal cues).

### 6 PCs
- 5 Arcane Sentinels.
- 3 Spell Scramblers.
- 1 Silence Wraith.
- Add 1 **Glyph Guardian** (use Gargoyle, CR 2; guards center pedestal; only activates if PCs attempt Exit Seal with wrong sequence).

### Enemy Tactics
- **Arcane Sentinels** patrol predictably; attack PCs at pedestals (forcing them to defend or flee mid-puzzle).
- **Spell Scramblers** use *minor illusion* to project fake inscriptions or overlay gibberish on real clues (Investigation DC 13 to detect fake).
- **Silence Wraith** creates 20-foot-radius *silence* zones; forces PCs to use written/visual communication only (increases difficulty).
- **Glyph Guardian** only attacks if Exit Seal is triggered incorrectly; otherwise remains dormant (scary statue).

## Objectives
- **Primary:** Decode all five clues and activate the Exit Seal in the correct sequence.
- **Secondary:** Escape within 10 rounds (timer creates urgency).
- **Tertiary:** Minimize damage from enemies and seal resets (bonus Favor for efficient solving).

## Round Timer
- **Rounds 1-5:** Enemies patrol slowly; Sentinels move 20 feet/round; Scramblers create minor distractions.
- **Rounds 6-8:** Enemies become aggressive; Sentinels move 30 feet/round; Scramblers spam illusions; Silence Wraith activates.
- **Rounds 9-10:** **Collapsing Sands** (see Hazards below)—arena floor begins to crumble at edges.
- **Round 11+:** If PCs haven't escaped, entire floor collapses (all PCs make Dex save DC 16 or fall into pit; 6d6 bludgeoning, prone, need to climb out).

## Crowd Favor Hooks
- First PC to read a clue aloud (in their unique language) and attempt to share it: +1 [[crowds_favor_mechanic|Favor]].
- Creatively communicate a clue using gestures/drawings (DM's judgment): +1 Favor.
- Defeat an Arcane Sentinel while defending a pedestal: +1 Favor.
- Detect and dispel a Spell Scrambler's fake clue: +1 Favor.
- Activate the Exit Seal correctly on first attempt (no resets): +3 Favor.
- Escape within 7 rounds (fast puzzle solve): +2 Favor.
- Use [[panache_mechanics|Panache]] to distract enemies while another PC reads clues: +1 Favor to both.

## Tactical Elements
- **Language Barrier:** PCs must invent communication methods. Examples:
  - Draw symbols in sand (flame = wavy lines, blade = straight line pointing up, etc.).
  - Pantomime (flap arms for "crown," point down for "water").
  - Use objects as props (hold torch for "flame," stick for "blade").
- **Split Attention:** Some PCs defend while others read/solve; requires coordination despite communication block.
- **Illusion Detection:** Spell Scramblers create fake clues; PCs need Investigation checks or *detect magic* to identify real vs. fake.
- **Silence Zones:** If Silence Wraith activates, even gestures requiring sound (clapping, stomping) fail; PCs must rely purely on visual cues.
- **Sequence Deduction:** Clues are numbered ("First," "Second," etc.) but scattered; PCs must gather all five, piece together order, then execute.

## Hazards and Twists
- **Seal Reset Damage:** Incorrect sequence deals 2d6 force damage in 10-foot radius; punishes trial-and-error.
- **Fake Clues:** Spell Scramblers create illusory inscriptions (Investigation DC 13 to detect); mix false info into puzzle.
- **Silence Zones:** 20-foot radius *silence* (1-minute duration) from Silence Wraith; blocks verbal/sonic communication.
- **Collapsing Sands (Round 9+):** Arena edges crumble inward; reduces safe area by 5 feet per round; Dex save DC 14 or fall (3d6 damage, difficult to climb back up).
- **Glyph Guardian Activation:** If Exit Seal is triggered incorrectly, Guardian animates and attacks (AC 15, 52 HP, multiattack).

## Announcer Beats
- Opening: "Language fails! Words turn to ash! Scattered clues hold your freedom—but can you solve the riddle **without speaking?!**"
- First clue read: "One inscription deciphered! Four remain! The sands hold secrets, gladiators!"
- First seal attempt (incorrect): "WRONG! The seal rejects them! Pain is the price of failure!"
- Silence Wraith activates: "Now even gestures fall to silence! How will they **communicate the uncommunicable?!**"
- Round 9 (collapse starts): "The sands betray! The arena crumbles! **Solve it NOW or be swallowed!**"
- Correct sequence: "The seal glows! The door OPENS! They cracked the code! **Freedom through wit, not blades!** Tarsus roars!"

## GM Tips
- **Pre-Session Prep:** Assign each PC one unique language they retain (based on backgrounds/sheets). Print clue cards in those languages.
- **Encourage Creativity:** Reward PCs who use props, sand drawings, body language, or clever workarounds. Don't penalize "imperfect" communication; reward effort.
- **Track Clue Discovery:** Use a checklist: which pedestals visited, which clues read, who knows what. Encourage PCs to share (despite language barrier).
- **Illusion Traps:** Spell Scramblers create convincing fakes; don't make it obvious. Let PCs investigate or use *detect magic*.
- **Silence Wraith Timing:** Activate *silence* mid-puzzle (round 6-7) to spike difficulty; forces PCs to rely on writing/visuals only.
- **Collapsing Sands Visual:** Describe edges crumbling vividly; use battle map to shrink safe area visually each round. Creates urgency.
- **Seal Sequence:** Clues are numbered ("First," "Second," etc.); PCs must gather all five, determine order, then execute. Don't give it away; let them work for it.
- **Enemy Harassment:** Sentinels attack but aren't overwhelming; meant to distract, not TPK. Scramblers are annoying but low HP (easy to kill if PCs prioritize).

## Aftermath Seeds
- **Patron Interest:** Arcane academy impressed by puzzle-solving; offers scholarship or research access.
- **Rumor:** The language curse was prototype magic from a rival mage guild; they're testing combat applications. Conspiracy brewing.
- **Downtime:** PC who decoded the most clues gains **Linguist's Insight** (advantage on Intelligence checks to decipher codes or unknown languages for 1 week).
- **Injury:** PC who triggered the seal incorrectly suffers **Arcane Burn** (disadvantage on Intelligence saves for 1d4 days; can be removed via *lesser restoration*).
- **Political:** Puzzle sponsor furious if PCs destroyed pedestals or Guardian; demands compensation. Patron drama ensues.
- **Loot:** Pedestals yield **Language Shards** (crystal fragments; consume to understand one language for 1 hour; 1d3 shards per pedestal, 25 gp each).
