# The Blind Orchestra

- **Hook:** Ancient bells hang throughout a darkened arena. Gladiators are blinded by magical darkness, but each bell chimes with a specific note when struck. Hidden sheet music provides the "song of escape"—but enemies hunt in the dark, and wrong notes awaken worse horrors. Can they fight, listen, and perform the melody before the darkness claims them?
- **Party:** 3-5 PCs. All are blinded (magical darkness, *darkvision* doesn't work). Must coordinate through sound, memory, and trust. Emphasizes cooperation, pattern recognition, and fighting without sight.

## Arena Layout

- Circular chamber (80-foot diameter), plunged into impenetrable magical darkness (no light sources work).
- **Six Bell Towers:** Scattered throughout arena (marked positions 12, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 o'clock), each 10 feet tall with climbable ladder (Athletics DC 10).
- **Each bell chimes a distinct note:** C, D, E, F, G, A (musical scale). Bells are labeled with raised symbols (can be felt by touch—DC 12 Investigation to read Braille-like runes).
- **Central Platform:** 20-foot-diameter raised stone disc (5 feet high); only "safe zone" where enemies won't attack (but PCs must leave to ring bells).
- **Hidden Sheet Music:** Four stone tablets scattered at ground level near bell towers (DC 14 Investigation to find by touch, or 10 if actively searching specific area). Each tablet has one phrase of the complete melody.
- **Sound Echo:** All sounds echo dramatically—footsteps, combat, bell chimes. PCs can use echolocation (Perception DC 13) to sense movement within 20 feet.

## Melody Puzzle (Core Objective)

**The Song of Escape:**
- Complete melody: **C-D-E-C, E-F-G, G-A-G-F-E-C** (12 notes total)
- Must be played in order on correct bells by striking them with weapons or fists (standard action).
- Each phrase is written on one of four stone tablets:
  1. "First the rising scale, return to start" (C-D-E-C)
  2. "Climb three more to rest" (E-F-G)
  3. "Peak descends through valley" (G-A-G-F)
  4. "Home again, the journey's end" (E-C)
- PCs must find all four tablets, decipher the musical directions, remember the sequence, navigate to correct bells in darkness, and perform the melody.
- **Success:** When final note (C) is struck correctly, darkness lifts, doors open, combat ends (remaining enemies flee or surrender).
- **Failure:** Incorrect notes trigger environmental hazards or spawn additional enemies (see below).

## Darkness Combat Mechanic

**All PCs are Blinded:**
- Attack rolls have disadvantage (cannot see targets).
- Automatically fail Perception checks requiring sight.
- Enemies are also fighting blind (unless they have blindsight).
- **Echolocation Option:** PC can use action to listen carefully (Perception DC 13); success reveals position of nearest creature within 20 feet (direction and approximate distance, not exact location).
- **Teamwork Essential:** PCs must call out enemy positions to each other: "Two goblins, 15 feet north!" "Something large near the E bell!"

## Enemies (Sonic Hunters)

### 3-4 PCs:
- 3 **Blind Goblins** (CR 1/4; have blindsight 30 feet, expert darkness fighters, cackle to disorient PCs).
- 2 **Echo Bats** (reskin Stirges; CR 1/8; have blindsight 60 feet, screech to confuse echolocation—DC 12 Wisdom save or disadvantage on next Perception check).
- 1 **Silence Predator** (reskin Invisible Stalker, reduced to CR 4; has blindsight 60 feet, can cast *silence* 1/day to eliminate sound-based navigation, multiattack).

### 5 PCs:
- 4 Blind Goblins.
- 3 Echo Bats.
- 1 Silence Predator.
- 1 **Darkness Elemental** (reskin Shadow Demon; CR 4; has blindsight 120 feet, incorporeal, vulnerability to thunder damage, can possess PCs to force wrong bell strikes).

### Enemy Tactics:
- **Blind Goblins:** Patrol between bell towers, ambush PCs attempting to ring bells, use hit-and-run tactics (strike and retreat into darkness).
- **Echo Bats:** Swarm PCs who successfully use echolocation, screech to disrupt their senses.
- **Silence Predator:** Casts *silence* on areas where PCs are coordinating verbally, forcing them to separate or fight without communication.
- **Darkness Elemental:** Possesses PCs (DC 14 Charisma save) to force them to strike wrong bells or attack allies.

## Wrong Note Consequences

When an incorrect note is played (out of sequence or wrong bell):
- **Minor Discord (First 2 mistakes):** Thunder damage pulse (2d6 thunder damage, 20-foot radius from struck bell, DC 13 Con save for half).
- **Major Discord (3rd+ mistakes):** Summons 1d4 **Scream Wraiths** (reskin Shadows; CR 1/2; have blindsight 60 feet, necrotic damage attacks, drawn to sound of discord).
- **Catastrophic Discord (5+ mistakes):** Arena begins collapsing (initiative count 10 each round, random 10-foot-radius section crumbles, DC 15 Dex save or fall 20 feet into spike pit, 4d6 piercing).

## Crowd Favor Hooks

- Find a stone tablet without triggering wrong note: +1 [[crowds_favor|Favor]] for thoroughness.
- Ring a correct note in sequence without hesitation: +1 Favor per correct note (max +12 for perfect performance).
- Kill an enemy using only sound-based navigation (no sight): +2 Favor for blind mastery.
- Rescue an ally from enemy ambush by following their calls for help: +2 Favor for teamwork.
- Complete the melody with 1 or fewer wrong notes: +4 Favor for near-perfect performance.
- Defeat Silence Predator using thunder damage (exploiting its vulnerability to sound-based magic): +2 Favor for irony.
- Use echolocation successfully 3+ times in combat: +1 Favor for adaptation.
- [[panache|Panache]] strike final bell note (C) to lift darkness: +3 Favor for dramatic finish.
- One PC "conducts" others through melody by voice commands while blind: +2 Favor for leadership.

## Coordination Mechanics

**Communication is Survival:**
- PCs must constantly talk: "I'm at the C bell!" "Goblin approaching your left!" "Need help finding tablet!"
- *Silence* spell is devastating—forces non-verbal coordination (tapping, touching, physical guidance).
- Darkness makes visual signals impossible; only sound, touch, and trust work.

**Memory Challenge:**
- Once tablets are found and read, PCs must remember the melody (no writing visible in darkness).
- One PC can memorize (INT check DC 12) or team can repeat it verbally: "C-D-E-C, E-F-G..."
- Enemies will try to separate PCs to disrupt memory sharing.

**Navigation:**
- Bell towers are at fixed positions (clock face layout).
- PCs can count steps, use echolocation, or create "breadcrumb" markers (torn cloth, dropped items) to navigate.
- Falling off central platform = 1d6 bludgeoning, disoriented (disadvantage on next Perception check).

## Announcer Beats

- Opening: "DARKNESS CONSUMES! Six bells ring in shadow! Can they hear the path to freedom—or will wrong notes seal their doom?!"
- First bell struck (correct): "A PURE NOTE! The song begins! The crowd listens with BATED BREATH!"
- First wrong note: "DISCORD! The bells REJECT the melody! Pain echoes through the dark!"
- Enemy ambush: "They strike from shadow! Can blind warriors defend against blind hunters?!"
- Tablet found: "They search, they find! One piece of the puzzle CLAIMED!"
- *Silence* cast: "THE SOUND DIES! No voices! No echos! ISOLATION ABSOLUTE!"
- Final note struck (victory): "THE LAST NOTE! C! THE DARKNESS LIFTS! The orchestra SUCCEEDS! LIGHT RETURNS!"
- Defeat: "The melody incomplete, the darkness eternal! They fall in silence!"

## GM Tips

- **Player Immersion:** Encourage players to close eyes or wear blindfolds for immersion (optional).
- **Describe Everything by Sound:** "You hear steel scraping stone to your left." "Goblin breathing 10 feet ahead."
- **Combat Narration:** Focus on audio cues—"You hear goblin footsteps circling." "A screech above—bats diving!"
- **Memory Aid:** Allow PCs to keep notes of melody sequence in real life (simulates their characters memorizing).
- **Spatial Awareness:** Use battle mat with numbered positions for bell towers; let PCs point/move tokens even if characters can't see.
- **Sound Effects:** If playing online, use actual bell sounds or music to enhance atmosphere.
- **Echolocation Rewards:** When PCs use it successfully, describe layout: "You sense two small creatures near the eastern wall."
- **Pacing:** First 2-3 rounds = chaos and orientation. Mid-fight = tablet hunting and combat. Final rounds = melody performance under pressure.
- **Communication Praise:** When PCs coordinate well verbally, reward with Favor.

## Tactical Elements

- **Safe Zone Dilemma:** Central platform is safe but useless for objectives—must venture into darkness.
- **Sound Discipline:** Loud combat (heavy weapons, thunder spells) helps enemies track PCs; stealth has value.
- **Divide and Conquer:** Enemies try to separate PCs; darkness makes regrouping difficult.
- **Environmental Audio:** Bell chimes create temporary "sound maps"—PCs can use them to orient.
- **Possession Risk:** Darkness Elemental can force PCs to sabotage melody; teammates must recognize possessed behavior.

## Aftermath Seeds

- **Echo Sight:** PC who successfully used echolocation 5+ times gains "Attuned to Silence" trait—advantage on Perception checks in darkness/deafened conditions (1 week duration, then fades).
- **Patron Interest:** Blind musicians' guild impressed by performance under pressure—offers "Sonic Combat" training (learn Thunder damage cantrip or Fighting Style: Blind Fighting).
- **Rumor:** The bells were stolen from a monastery of blind monks—sacred instruments now defiled. Monks seek their return; will PCs aid them or claim them as loot?
- **Downtime:** Each bell can be harvested (DC 16 Athletics, requires 2 hours)—sells for 100 gp to collectors or can be installed in PC base for musical ambiance.
- **Injury:** PC who suffered multiple Echo Bat screeches develops temporary tinnitus (disadvantage on hearing-based Perception for 3 days; cosmetic).
- **Legendary Moment:** If melody completed with zero wrong notes, crowd goes silent in awe before erupting; "The Perfect Performance" becomes legendary tale; bards seek to interview PCs.
- **Political:** Arena stole the darkness magic from rival city's shadow mages—diplomatic incident brewing, PCs may be subpoenaed as witnesses.
- **Cursed Memory:** PC who struck 3+ wrong notes haunted by discordant ringing in dreams (no mechanical effect, just unsettling roleplay).
- **Loot:** Stone tablets can be kept—each grants one-time use of *comprehend languages* (magical runes activate when touched, crumble after use).
