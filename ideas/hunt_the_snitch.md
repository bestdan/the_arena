# Hunt the Snitch

Multiple time-limited objective scenarios where gladiators must find, catch, or assemble specific items/creatures before time expires. Inspired by high-speed chases and treasure hunts with deadly opposition.

---

## Scenario 1: The Golden Serpent

**Hook:** A magical golden serpent (the "Snitch") has been released into the arena. First team to catch it wins riches and freedom for one gladiator. But it's fast, elusive, and everyone else wants it too.

### Arena Layout
- Circular arena (100-foot diameter) with central fountain (20 feet across, 10 feet tall)—serpent emerges from here Round 1.
- Four stone archways (North, South, East, West) provide partial cover; serpent can slither through/under them.
- Scattered pillars (10 feet tall, 5 feet diameter) create obstacles; serpent uses them to break line of sight.
- Sand pit sections (15-foot patches) are difficult terrain for PCs but not the serpent.
- Rope nets hanging from arena ceiling (15 feet up)—can be pulled down with Athletics DC 13 to create snare zones.

### The Golden Serpent
- **Speed:** 60 feet per turn (flies/slithers erratically).
- **AC:** 18 (magical scales, small size, evasive).
- **HP:** 1 (any hit subdues it, but hitting AC 18 while it's moving is the challenge).
- **Abilities:** Can't be grappled except on a successful Athletics/Acrobatics check DC 18 (requires being within 5 feet). Immune to magic that would hold/slow it (enchanted for the hunt).
- **Movement Pattern:** Roll 1d8 each round—serpent darts toward that compass direction (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) at full speed. If it hits a wall, it ricochets in a random new direction (1d8 again).
- **Detection:** Glows faintly gold; always visible but moves too fast to track easily. Starts in fountain, emerges Round 1.

### Enemies (Rival Gladiators)
Other teams want the serpent too—they'll fight PCs AND chase it.

**4 PCs:**
- 3 **Rival Gladiators** (use Bandit Captain stats, CR 2; weapons: nets, javelins, shortswords).
- 1 **Beast Handler** with trained **Giant Lizard** (CR 1/4)—lizard can attempt to catch serpent if commanded.

**5-6 PCs:**
- 4 Rival Gladiators.
- 1 Beast Handler + Giant Lizard.
- 1 **Elusive Rogue** (use Assassin stats reduced to 50 HP, CR 5; expertise in Acrobatics, tries to catch serpent solo).

### Round Timer: 12 Rounds
- **Rounds 1-4:** Serpent moves predictably (1d8 direction). Crowd murmurs.
- **Rounds 5-8:** Serpent accelerates—moves 80 feet per turn. Announcer hypes tension.
- **Rounds 9-12:** Serpent moves 100 feet per turn, zigzags wildly (roll 1d8 twice, move in both directions). Crowd chants countdown.
- **Round 12 End:** If serpent uncaught, it vanishes in golden flash—no winner. Crowd boos; all gladiators punished (reduced rations, no rewards).

### Catching the Serpent
- **Melee Attack:** Hit AC 18 while within 5 feet—serpent is subdued. Requires readied action or mobility to close distance.
- **Ranged Attack:** Hit AC 18 with ranged attack (nets grant advantage, magical restraint fails). Serpent drops at impact point.
- **Grapple Check:** Get within 5 feet, succeed Athletics/Acrobatics DC 18—serpent caught.
- **Snare/Trap:** Pull down rope net (action, Athletics DC 13) to create 10-foot snare zone. If serpent moves through, it's tangled—auto-caught.
- **Magic:** *Hold person* fails (not a person). *Web*, *entangle* slowed by enchantment (serpent moves at half speed for 1 round, DC 15 spell save). *Polymorph*, *banishment* disqualify the catcher (crowd deems it unsporting—guards attack).

### Objectives
- **Primary:** Catch the Golden Serpent before Round 12 ends.
- **Secondary:** Eliminate rival gladiators (reduces competition, earns Favor).
- **Tertiary:** Catch serpent with [[panaches|Panache]] (diving tackle, mid-air intercept, trick shot).

### [[crowds_favor|Crowd Favor]] Hooks
- First PC to get within 5 feet of serpent: +1 Favor.
- Catch serpent with a net throw (ranged attack): +2 Favor.
- Catch serpent with acrobatic grapple (Acrobatics check vs. Athletics): +3 Favor for flair.
- Eliminate a rival gladiator with Panache while serpent is nearby: +2 Favor (multitasking!).
- Set a trap (rope net snare) that successfully catches serpent: +2 Favor.
- Catch serpent in final round (Round 12): +4 Favor for clutch timing.
- Catch serpent solo (no ally assistance): +2 Favor for glory.

### Rival Tactics
- Rivals split attention: 2 chase serpent, others guard/block PCs.
- Beast Handler commands lizard to intercept serpent's path (readied action).
- Elusive Rogue (if present) uses Dash + Cunning Action to pursue serpent relentlessly; ignores PCs unless attacked.
- Rivals use nets and javelins to slow PCs (grapple, prone conditions).
- If a rival catches serpent, PCs can attack them to force a drop (serpent escapes, rolls 1d8 again).

### Hazards
- **Fountain Spray:** Serpent circles fountain occasionally; water sprays 10-foot radius (Dex save DC 12 or blinded for 1 round, disadvantage on attacks).
- **Pillar Collapse:** If serpent or combat damages a pillar, it topples (1d10 bludgeoning, Dex DC 13, 5-foot line).
- **Sand Shifts:** Difficult terrain patches expand slightly each round (1d4 feet in random direction).

### Announcer Beats
- **Opening:** "THE GOLDEN SERPENT! Swift as lightning, precious as emperors' crowns! CATCH IT—and earn your FREEDOM!"
- **First chase:** "Look at them sprint! The serpent mocks them with every twist!"
- **Rivals engage:** "Blood spills—but the serpent remains FREE! Who will claim the prize?!"
- **Round 8:** "Half the time GONE! The serpent ACCELERATES! Can they keep pace?!"
- **Final round:** "TWELVE! This is IT! Catch it NOW or lose EVERYTHING!"
- **Victory:** "CAUGHT! The Golden Serpent yields! [Winner name] has seized GLORY!" (crowd erupts)
- **Failure:** "TIME EXPIRES! The serpent VANISHES! No champions today—only DISAPPOINTMENT!" (crowd boos)

### Aftermath Seeds
- **Victory:** Winner chooses one gladiator (self or ally) for immediate freedom OR 1,000 gp reward split among team.
- **Serpent Loot:** Catching it without killing (AC 18 but subdued) grants serpent as magical item: **Golden Serpent Talisman** (acts as *ring of feather falling*, can cast *expeditious retreat* 1/day).
- **Rival Rivalry:** Defeated rivals hold grudges; one swears vendetta, returns as assassin in later session.
- **Patron Interest:** Noble who sponsored the serpent hunt impressed by style; offers sponsorship contract (better gear, political backing).
- **Injury:** PC who caught serpent bitten during struggle—non-lethal but gains **Serpent's Mark** (faint golden scar; advantage on Persuasion with reptilian creatures for 1 week).
- **Political:** Losing gladiators blamed for "boring" match—arena master punishes with harder fights next session.

## Scenario 2: The Scavenger's Gauntlet

**Hook:** Three artifact fragments hidden across a multi-level arena. Assemble them to unlock the exit before toxic fog fills the chamber. Rivals and guardians hunt the same prizes.

### Arena Layout
- Three-tiered vertical arena (30 feet per tier, 90 feet total height).
  - **Tier 1 (Ground Floor):** Maze of stone walls (5 feet tall, provides cover); central staircase to Tier 2.
  - **Tier 2 (Mid-Level):** Open platform with crumbling bridges (requires Acrobatics DC 12 to cross safely or fall 30 feet); ladder to Tier 3.
  - **Tier 3 (Top Level):** Narrow walkways, broken pillars, hanging chains—risky terrain (Dex save DC 13 to avoid falling when attacked).
- **Exit Portal:** Center of Tier 1; locked with arcane seal. Requires all 3 fragments to open.
- **Fog Vents:** Base of each tier; toxic fog rises steadily (covers Tier 1 by Round 8, Tier 2 by Round 12, Tier 3 by Round 15). See Round Timer for details.

### The Artifact Fragments
Three glowing relic pieces scattered across tiers—randomly placed each session (DM pre-assigns or rolls 1d6 per tier to determine hiding spots).

- **Fragment 1 (Tier 1):** Hidden in maze (Investigation DC 14 to locate; takes 1 action to retrieve).
- **Fragment 2 (Tier 2):** Guarded by **Stone Golem** (CR 10, reduced to 100 HP for balance; stands motionless until fragment is approached within 10 feet).
- **Fragment 3 (Tier 3):** Dangling from a chain (requires Athletics DC 15 to climb or ranged attack to shoot down; falls if chain is cut, must catch with Dex save DC 13 or it shatters—restarts hunt for replacement fragment).

### Enemies
**4 PCs:**
- 2 **Rival Scavengers** (use Scouts, CR 1/2; expertise in Investigation, sprint for fragments).
- 1 **Stone Golem** guarding Fragment 2 (CR 10, 100 HP; attacks anyone within 10 feet of fragment).
- 3 **Gargoyles** (CR 2; patrol Tier 3, divebomb PCs who reach top level).

**5-6 PCs:**
- 3 Rival Scavengers.
- 1 Stone Golem (full HP: 178).
- 4 Gargoyles.
- 1 **Rival Leader** (use Gladiator, CR 5; collects fragments, coordinates scavengers).

### Round Timer: 15 Rounds (Fog Rises)
- **Rounds 1-4:** No fog; exploration and combat.
- **Rounds 5-8:** Fog covers Tier 1 (anyone in fog: Con save DC 13 at start of turn or 2d6 poison damage).
- **Rounds 9-12:** Fog covers Tier 2 (same save, 3d6 poison damage).
- **Rounds 13-15:** Fog covers Tier 3 (same save, 4d6 poison damage). Crowd chants countdown.
- **Round 15 End:** If exit unopened, all gladiators in arena die (fog fills entire space; TPK unless teleported out by merciful patron).

### Fragment Assembly
- Collecting all 3 fragments: One PC must carry all three, reach exit portal (center Tier 1), use action to insert them.
- Portal opens instantly—anyone within 10 feet can escape as a free action.
- Scavengers/rivals carrying fragments can be attacked to force drops (fragments don't break, just fall).

### Objectives
- **Primary:** Collect all 3 fragments and open exit portal before Round 15.
- **Secondary:** Eliminate rival scavengers (prevents them from collecting fragments first).
- **Tertiary:** Escape without anyone dropping to 0 HP (bonus Favor).

### [[crowds_favor|Crowd Favor]] Hooks
- First PC to find a fragment: +1 Favor.
- Defeat Stone Golem with [[panaches|Panache]]: +3 Favor (declaring dramatic attack).
- Retrieve Fragment 3 from hanging chain with acrobatic catch (Dex save DC 13): +2 Favor.
- Open exit portal in final 3 rounds (Rounds 13-15): +3 Favor for clutch timing.
- Carry all 3 fragments solo (no passing to allies): +2 Favor for glory-hog.
- Defeat a Gargoyle mid-air (readied action or jump attack): +2 Favor.
- Escape fog-filled tier without taking damage (successful saves): +1 Favor.

### Rival Tactics
- Scavengers split up—each targets a different fragment.
- Rival Leader (if present) coordinates via shouts; directs scavengers to prioritize unclaimed fragments.
- If a scavenger gets a fragment, they dash toward Tier 1 exit (ignores combat unless blocked).
- Stone Golem doesn't pursue—only attacks within 10 feet of Fragment 2 pedestal.
- Gargoyles harass PCs on Tier 3, use flyby attacks to knock fragments from hands (Str save DC 13 or drop item).

### Hazards
- **Crumbling Bridges (Tier 2):** Acrobatics DC 12 to cross; failure = fall 30 feet to Tier 1 (3d6 bludgeoning).
- **Toxic Fog:** Rises 10 feet per round; Con save DC 13 at start of turn or poison damage (scales with tier).
- **Falling Debris:** Stone Golem's slam attacks shake structure (Dex save DC 12 or 1d6 bludgeoning from falling rubble; 10-foot radius).
- **Chain Breaks:** If Fragment 3's chain is cut carelessly (non-ranged attack), fragment falls—Dex save DC 13 or it shatters, forcing PCs to search for backup fragment (Investigation DC 16, takes 2 rounds).

### Announcer Beats
- **Opening:** "Three fragments! Three tiers! ONE EXIT! Find them before the FOG DEVOURS YOU!"
- **First fragment found:** "A FRAGMENT CLAIMED! Two remain—and the fog RISES!"
- **Golem activates:** "Stone awakens! Guardian of the relic—CAN THEY DEFEAT IT?!"
- **Fog reaches Tier 1:** "The fog HUNGERS! Tier One is LOST! Climb or CHOKE!"
- **Round 13:** "THREE ROUNDS LEFT! The air thins! ASSEMBLE THE FRAGMENTS OR DIE!"
- **Exit opens:** "THE PORTAL FLARES! ESCAPE—or prove you're COWARDS!" (crowd roars)
- **Victory:** "THEY SURVIVE! The Scavenger's Gauntlet is CONQUERED!" (trumpets blare)
- **Failure:** "FOG CLAIMS ALL! No survivors! Tarsus mourns—and forgets!" (crowd silenced)

### Aftermath Seeds
- **Victory:** Assembled artifact is **Triad Amulet** (grants *misty step* 3/day; 1,200 gp value).
- **Golem Loot:** Defeating Stone Golem yields **Golem Core Shard** (can be sold for 400 gp or used to craft *stone skin* potion).
- **Rival Grudge:** Scavenger who lost fragments swears revenge; later session features ambush.
- **Patron Reward:** Noble impressed by speed/strategy offers contract: "retrieve more relics from dangerous ruins" (side quest hook).
- **Injury:** PC who inhaled fog heavily (failed 3+ saves) gains **Toxic Scarring** (disadvantage on Con saves for 1d4 days).
- **Political:** Arena master pleased with "exciting vertical combat"; future matches feature more multi-tier arenas (DM campaign note).

## Scenario 3: The Phoenix Egg Chase

**Hook:** A phoenix egg has been released into the arena. It hatches in 10 rounds—whichever team holds it when it hatches gains the phoenix's loyalty (and a powerful magical ally). But the egg is hot, fast, and everyone's fighting for it.

### Arena Layout
- Oval arena (120x80 feet) with volcanic terrain theme.
- Central lava pit (30-foot diameter)—egg starts here, floating on a stone platform (5 feet above lava).
- Four stone bridges (10 feet wide) cross lava pit at North, South, East, West—partially collapsed (Acrobatics DC 11 to cross safely or fall into lava: 3d10 fire damage).
- Scattered lava vents (5-foot geysers)—erupt randomly (DM rolls 1d6 each round; on 5-6, random vent erupts, 10-foot radius, 2d6 fire damage, Dex save DC 13 half).
- Cooled obsidian pillars (10 feet tall) provide cover and high ground (Athletics DC 12 to climb).
- Arena edges lined with fireproof barriers—crowd watches safely behind enchanted glass.

### The Phoenix Egg
- **Size:** Small (can be carried in one hand).
- **Weight:** Weightless (magically buoyant).
- **Heat:** Holder takes 1d4 fire damage at start of each turn (resistances apply). Can drop egg as a free action.
- **Movement:** If dropped, egg floats/rolls 1d20 feet in random direction (1d8 compass bearing) at end of round—erratic!
- **Hatching Timer:** 10 rounds. At start of Round 11, egg hatches (see below).
- **Stealing:** Holder can be grappled or disarmed (Athletics/Acrobatics contest) to force drop. Egg falls, rolls randomly.

### Hatching Outcome
- **If PC holds egg at start of Round 11:** Phoenix hatches, imprints on PC. Phoenix becomes loyal ally (use **Phoenix** stat block from Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes—CR 16; reduce HP to 100 and remove lair actions for CR 8 balance; stays for 1 hour or until killed, then reforms in egg).
- **If enemy/rival holds egg:** Phoenix attacks PCs (hostile, full CR 16 stats with lair actions).
- **If egg unclaimed (dropped):** Phoenix hatches neutral—ignores everyone, flies away. No reward (crowd boos).

### Enemies (Rival Teams)
**4 PCs:**
- 3 **Fire Cult Warriors** (use Cult Fanatics, CR 2; immune to fire, wield flaming weapons).
- 1 **Salamander** (CR 5; allies with cultists, breathes fire, tries to retrieve egg for itself).

**5-6 PCs:**
- 4 Fire Cult Warriors.
- 1 Salamander.
- 1 **Fire Elemental** (CR 5; rampages, incinerates anyone near egg).
- 1 **Cult Leader** (use Priest with *fireball* prepared, CR 2; directs cultists, wants egg for ritual).

### Round Timer: 10 Rounds (Egg Hatches)
- **Rounds 1-3:** Egg floats on platform; gladiators race to claim it. Crowd roars.
- **Rounds 4-6:** Egg changes hands frequently (combat, forced drops). Lava vents erupt more often (roll 1d6 twice per round).
- **Rounds 7-9:** Egg glows brighter; heat intensifies (holder takes 1d6 fire damage per turn). Announcer hypes hatching.
- **Round 10:** "ONE ROUND LEFT! The egg TREMBLES! Who will claim the phoenix?!"
- **Round 11 Start:** Egg HATCHES. Phoenix emerges (outcome depends on holder—see above).

### Egg Mechanics
- **Claiming Egg:** Action to pick up (if within 5 feet). Can be thrown as improvised weapon (20/60 range, 1d4 fire damage, Dex save DC 13 or egg drops at impact point).
- **Holding Egg:** Takes 1d4 fire damage per turn (1d6 in Rounds 7-9). Fire resistance halves damage; immunity negates.
- **Dropping Egg:** Free action. Egg rolls 1d20 feet in random direction (1d8 compass) at end of round. Can land in lava pit (floats on surface; safe to retrieve if approached via bridge).
- **Stealing Egg:** Grapple holder (Athletics/Acrobatics contest) or Disarm (Battle Master maneuver, etc.)—holder must drop egg.

### Objectives
- **Primary:** Hold phoenix egg at start of Round 11 (when it hatches).
- **Secondary:** Eliminate rival cultists and salamander (reduces competition).
- **Tertiary:** Hold egg continuously from Round 5 onward without dropping (bonus Favor for control).

### [[crowds_favor|Crowd Favor]] Hooks
- First PC to claim egg: +1 Favor.
- Hold egg for 3 consecutive rounds without dropping: +2 Favor.
- Steal egg from rival with grapple/disarm: +2 Favor.
- Throw egg to ally across lava pit (successful ranged "pass"): +2 Favor for teamwork.
- Survive holding egg in Rounds 7-9 (1d6 fire damage): +1 Favor per round survived.
- Defeat Salamander with [[panaches|Panache]] while holding egg: +4 Favor (multitasking badass).
- Hold egg when it hatches (Round 11): +5 Favor for ultimate victory.

### Rival Tactics
- Cultists prioritize claiming egg—use flaming weapons to threaten egg-holders ("Drop it or burn!").
- Salamander breathes fire to force PCs to drop egg (area damage around holder).
- Fire Elemental (if present) rampages toward egg; sets fire to pillars/bridges, creates chaos.
- Cult Leader (if present) casts *fireball* to scatter PCs, commands cultists to retrieve egg from chaos.
- If rival gets egg, they retreat to arena edge (defensive position), hold until hatching.

### Hazards
- **Lava Pit:** Falling in = 3d10 fire damage per round; Athletics DC 15 to climb out (takes full turn).
- **Lava Vents:** Erupt randomly (1d6 roll 5-6); 10-foot radius, 2d6 fire damage, Dex save DC 13 half.
- **Collapsing Bridge:** If bridge takes 20+ damage (combat, fire elemental), it collapses—anyone on it falls into lava.
- **Egg Explosion:** If egg is attacked directly (not holder, but egg itself), it cracks—releases fire burst (20-foot radius, 4d6 fire damage, Dex save DC 14 half; egg survives but resets hatching timer to 5 rounds).

### Announcer Beats
- **Opening:** "THE PHOENIX EGG! Ten rounds to hatching! Claim it—or face the INFERNO!"
- **First claim:** "The egg is SEIZED! But for how long?! The heat BURNS!"
- **Egg stolen:** "STOLEN! The egg changes hands! Chaos on the sands!"
- **Round 7:** "The egg GLOWS! Hatching approaches! Hold TIGHT or lose ALL!"
- **Round 10:** "ONE ROUND! The egg cracks! WHO WILL BOND WITH FIRE INCARNATE?!"
- **Hatching (PC victory):** "IT HATCHES! The phoenix SOARS—and it serves [PC name]! GLORY ETERNAL!" (crowd erupts)
- **Hatching (enemy victory):** "DISASTER! The phoenix turns on them! BURN, GLADIATORS, BURN!" (crowd gasps/screams)

### Aftermath Seeds
- **Phoenix Ally:** If PC successfully bonds with phoenix (see Hatching Outcome), it serves for 1 hour then dissolves into ash and reforms as dormant egg. PC keeps egg (takes 1 week to re-hatch; can repeat bonding process in future sessions).
- **Phoenix Feather:** Hatching yields 1d4 **Phoenix Feathers** (sell for 500 gp each or use as spell components for fire magic).
- **Cult Vendetta:** Surviving cultists swear revenge—later session features fire cult ambush or assassination attempt.
- **Patron Interest:** Fire mage noble impressed by heat resistance/strategy; offers contract for "dangerous fire plane expeditions."
- **Injury:** PC who held egg in Rounds 7-9 gains **Phoenix Brand** (permanent faint burn scar on palm; grants fire resistance for 1d4 days, then fades unless attuned to phoenix).
- **Political:** Arena master thrilled with "explosive spectacle"; future matches feature more elemental/beast bonding challenges.

## GM Tips (All Scenarios)

### Balancing Difficulty
- Adjust enemy numbers/CR for party size and level—these are templates, not rigid scripts.
- If PCs struggle with timer, add 2-3 rounds ("The crowd demands MORE drama!").
- If PCs trivialize challenge, add reinforcements or environmental hazards (collapsing terrain, second wave of rivals).

### Emphasizing Time Pressure
- Use visible timer (Roll20 countdown, physical hourglass, or announcer callouts).
- Every 2-3 rounds, announcer shouts time remaining: "EIGHT ROUNDS LEFT!" "FIVE ROUNDS!" "FINAL ROUND!"
- Crowd chants countdown in last 3 rounds: "Three! Two! One!"

### Snitch-Like Movement
- Golden Serpent, egg rolling—make it unpredictable. Don't telegraph where it'll go; roll randomly.
- Let PCs attempt to predict/intercept (Intelligence or Wisdom checks DC 14 to guess next direction; success = readied action bonus).

### Encouraging [[panaches|Panache]]
- Reward creative catches: diving tackles, mid-air intercepts, trick shots, acrobatic grapples.
- Announce Panache attempts to crowd: "LOOK AT THAT! A daring leap! Will they catch it?!" (builds tension).

### Aftermath Consistency
- Track injuries, loot, and patron interest across sessions.
- Rivals who survive should return as recurring NPCs (grudges, alliances, politics).
- Winning rare prizes (phoenix ally, freedom tokens) should feel impactful—don't trivialize rewards.

## Cross-Linking
- [[panaches]] for flashy catches/attacks.
- [[crowds_favor]] for earning audience approval.
- [[last_stand]] if a PC sacrifices themselves to pass the snitch/fragment to an ally (heroic death).
- [[environment/arena_details]] for physical arena staging and crowd dynamics.
