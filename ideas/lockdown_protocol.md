# Lockdown Protocol

- **Hook:** The arena initiates its emergency containment protocol—steel doors slam shut, gears grind, and automated defenses activate. PCs must navigate a gauntlet of locked passages, deadly traps, and ticking timers to reach the emergency exit before the final lockdown seals them in forever. The crowd watches the countdown with bated breath.
- **Party:** 4-6 PCs, level 5+. Emphasize quick thinking, trap handling, and coordinated multi-tasking under extreme time pressure.

## Arena Layout

- **Starting Cell** (20x20 feet)—PCs begin in a barred holding cell. A countdown clock on the wall shows **15 ROUNDS** until final lockdown.
- **Three Sequential Chambers** leading to the Emergency Exit:
  - **Chamber 1: The Vault Corridor** (60 feet long, 10 feet wide)—locked vault door at the end, trapped floor.
  - **Chamber 2: The Gear Room** (40x40 feet)—massive rotating gears, platforms, pressure plates.
  - **Chamber 3: The Gauntlet** (80 feet long, 15 feet wide)—arrow traps, swinging blades, collapsing floor.
- **Emergency Exit Door** (at the far end of Chamber 3)—requires three **colored keycards** to unlock (red, blue, green).
- **Clue System:** Each chamber contains one keycard and clues to the next chamber's traps.

## Time Pressure: The Countdown

- **Round 1:** Countdown begins. Cell door unlocks automatically. Alarm sounds: "CONTAINMENT BREACH. INITIATING LOCKDOWN PROTOCOL."
- **Round 5:** First warning. Automated voice: "10 rounds to final lockdown." Gas begins venting (lightly obscured, no damage yet).
- **Round 10:** Second warning. "5 rounds to final lockdown." Gas thickens (heavily obscured, Constitution save DC 12 or poisoned for 1 round).
- **Round 15:** Final lockdown. All doors seal. Poison gas fills all chambers (4d6 poison damage per round, no save). If keycards are not yet in position at the Emergency Exit, the door locks permanently and cannot be opened.

**Survival:** PCs must reach the Emergency Exit and insert all three keycards before Round 15, or find a way to disable the lockdown system.

## Chamber 1: The Vault Corridor

### Layout
- 60-foot-long stone corridor, 10 feet wide.
- **Vault Door** at the far end (massive steel, sealed, requires **Red Keycard** + password).
- Floor is a series of pressure plates (hidden, Investigation DC 15 to spot).
- **Control Panel** near the starting end with buttons and a riddle screen.

### Traps
- **Pressure Plates:** Stepping on unmarked plates triggers dart traps from the walls (Dex save DC 14 or take 2d6 piercing damage + poison, Constitution save DC 12 or 1d6 poison damage).
- Plates form a **safe path** (invisible pattern) that must be deduced via clues or trial-and-error.

### Puzzle: The Safe Path
The control panel displays a riddle:

*"Step where stone meets light, not shadow's embrace. The path is clear to those who see."*

**Solution:** The safe plates are those **illuminated by sconces** on the walls (7 sconces create overlapping light zones). PCs must step only on lit tiles. Investigation DC 13 or passive Perception 15 reveals the pattern. Alternatively, *detect magic* shows faint abjuration auras on safe plates.

**Shortcut:** A rogue can disable pressure plates manually (Thieves' Tools DC 16, 1 plate per action). High-risk, high-reward.

### Red Keycard
Located in a **locked strongbox** embedded in the wall near the Vault Door (Thieves' Tools DC 14 to pick, or AC 15, 30 HP to smash).

### Vault Door Password
The control panel also shows four symbols: ⚔️ (sword), 🛡️ (shield), 🔥 (flame), 💀 (skull). The password is hidden in the Starting Cell (written on the wall in small text): **"Sword Shield Flame Skull"** (enter symbols in this order: ⚔️🛡️🔥💀). PCs must return to input it, or recall it if they noted it earlier (Investigation DC 12 in Starting Cell reveals the writing).

**Opening the Vault Door:** Insert Red Keycard + enter correct password = door opens, revealing Chamber 2.

### Guardian: Automated Sentry
- 1 **Animated Armor** (CR 1) patrols the corridor, attacking PCs who trigger pressure plates (noise attracts it). It ignores PCs who walk the safe path silently.
- **Flex for 4 PCs:** Remove Animated Armor.
- **Flex for 6 PCs:** Add 2 **Flying Swords** (CR 1/4 each) that activate when Vault Door is approached.

### Clue to Chamber 2
Inside the strongbox with the Red Keycard is a note: *"The gears turn on the quarter hour. Time your steps."*

## Chamber 2: The Gear Room

### Layout
- 40x40-foot chamber with massive rotating gears protruding from walls and floor.
- Gears rotate constantly (complete rotation every 4 rounds).
- **Platforms** (5-foot squares) attached to gears; PCs must jump between them to cross the room.
- **Blue Keycard** is on a platform in the center, highest point of a large gear.
- **Exit Door** is on the far side, requires Blue Keycard to unlock.

### Hazard: Rotating Gears
- Gears rotate clockwise. Platforms rise and fall in a pattern (low → mid → high → low, repeating every 4 rounds).
- **Acrobatics DC 13** to jump between platforms safely. Failure = fall into gears (3d6 bludgeoning damage, Dex save DC 14 for half).
- PCs can attempt to **stop a gear** (Strength DC 18, disadvantage if alone) to freeze one platform temporarily (holds for 2 rounds before gear overwhelms them and resumes).

### Pressure Plate Puzzle
The floor has three **colored pressure plates** (red, blue, green). Stepping on them changes the gear rotation speed:
- **Red Plate:** Gears speed up (rotation time reduced to 3 rounds, harder jumps: Acrobatics DC 15).
- **Blue Plate:** Gears slow down (rotation time increased to 5 rounds, easier jumps: Acrobatics DC 11). (**Correct choice**)
- **Green Plate:** Gears reverse direction (clockwise → counter-clockwise, disorienting: Acrobatics DC 14 with disadvantage for 2 rounds).

**Clue:** The note from Chamber 1 ("quarter hour") hints at the Blue Plate (slowing time).

### Blue Keycard
Mounted on the highest platform of the central gear. Requires timing the jump correctly (Acrobatics DC 13 when platform is at peak height) or using magic (*levitate*, *fly*, *misty step*).

### Guardian: Gear Wraiths
- 2 **Shadows** (CR 1/2 each) emerge from the gears when PCs step on the Red Plate (speed-up). They can move through gears unharmed and drain Strength.
- **Flex for 4 PCs:** 1 Shadow only.
- **Flex for 6 PCs:** Add 1 **Wraith** (CR 5) that emerges if PCs destroy a gear (making it harder for themselves).

### Clue to Chamber 3
Etched on the platform holding the Blue Keycard: *"The blades swing in rhythm. Count to three."*

## Chamber 3: The Gauntlet

### Layout
- 80-foot-long corridor, 15 feet wide.
- **Swinging Blade Pendulums** (4 sets, 20 feet apart, swing side-to-side, 10-foot arc).
- **Arrow Slits** in walls (fire bolts at movement triggers).
- **Collapsing Floor Sections** (last 20 feet before the Emergency Exit).
- **Green Keycard** is embedded in the wall halfway through, behind a grate.

### Hazard 1: Swinging Blades
- Blades swing in **3-round cycles** (left → center → right → repeat).
- **Timing:** PCs must dash through when the blade swings away (Acrobatics DC 12 to time it, or Dex save DC 15 if rushing). Failure = 3d8 slashing damage.
- Clue from Chamber 2 ("Count to three") hints at the 3-round cycle.

### Hazard 2: Arrow Traps
- Triggered by **motion sensors** (detect movement faster than half-speed). Walking slowly (half movement) avoids triggering. Running/dashing = Dex save DC 14 or take 2d6 piercing damage from crossbow bolts.
- PCs can disable sensors (Thieves' Tools DC 15, 1 sensor per action, 6 sensors total).

### Hazard 3: Collapsing Floor
- Final 20 feet of corridor has weakened floor tiles (Investigation DC 14 to spot cracks).
- Each tile (5x5 feet) can support 200 lbs. If exceeded, tile collapses (10-foot fall, 1d6 bludgeoning, creature must climb back up, Athletics DC 12).
- Lightweight PCs or those using *feather fall* / *levitate* can cross safely.

### Green Keycard
Behind a **locked grate** in the wall (Thieves' Tools DC 14 to unlock, or AC 14, 25 HP to break). Located between the 2nd and 3rd blade traps.

### Guardian: Blade Sentinel
- 1 **Helmed Horror** (CR 4) emerges from an alcove when PCs reach the halfway point. It's immune to blade traps and attacks while PCs navigate hazards.
- **Flex for 4 PCs:** Use 1 **Veteran** (CR 3) instead.
- **Flex for 6 PCs:** Add 1 **Banshee** (CR 4) that wails when PCs retrieve the Green Keycard (Wail affects all within 30 feet).

### Clue to Emergency Exit
Engraved above the Green Keycard: *"Three keys, three slots. Red for power, Blue for time, Green for passage."*

## Emergency Exit Door

### Final Puzzle
The door has three keycard slots (red, blue, green) and a digital display showing the countdown.

**Solution:** Insert all three keycards into the correct slots:
- **Red Slot (Left):** "Power" (unlocks the locking mechanism).
- **Blue Slot (Center):** "Time" (halts the countdown timer).
- **Green Slot (Right):** "Passage" (opens the door).

**Order matters:** Must insert Red first (to power the system), then Blue (to stop countdown), then Green (to open). Wrong order triggers an **electric shock** (2d8 lightning damage to all PCs within 5 feet, Constitution save DC 14 for half).

**Success:** Door opens, revealing daylight and the roar of the crowd. PCs escape just as the final lockdown seals behind them.

## Alternate Win Condition: Disable the System

PCs can attempt to **hack the lockdown system** via control panels in each chamber. Requires:
- Successful Arcana or Investigation checks (DC 16) in all three chambers to understand the system.
- One PC must remain at a control panel and use an action to input commands while others gather keycards.
- Final override requires **Intelligence (Arcana) DC 18** check in Chamber 3. Success = countdown halts at current round, gas vents stop, all doors unlock.

## Enemies and Flex Scaling

### 4 PCs
- Remove Animated Armor from Chamber 1.
- 1 Shadow in Chamber 2.
- Use Veteran instead of Helmed Horror in Chamber 3.

### 5-6 PCs
- Use full stat blocks as written.
- Add 1 **Spectator** (CR 3) that hovers near the Emergency Exit in Chamber 3, firing eye rays to slow PCs down (activates on Round 12).

## Crowd Favor Hooks

- Deduce the safe path in Chamber 1 without triggering any traps: +2 [[crowds_favor|Favor]].
- Stop a gear manually to help an ally cross in Chamber 2: +1 Favor for teamwork.
- Navigate all swinging blades in Chamber 3 without taking damage: +2 Favor for precision.
- Disable the lockdown system via hacking instead of using keycards: +3 Favor for ingenuity.
- Insert all three keycards in the correct order on the first attempt: +2 Favor for deduction.
- Escape before Round 12: +3 Favor for speed.
- Use [[last_stand|Last Stand]] to buy time for allies to escape: +3 Favor (automatic per mechanics).

## Announcer Beats

- Opening: "CONTAINMENT BREACH! The lockdown protocol has ACTIVATED! Can they escape before the FINAL SEAL?!"
- Round 5: "TEN ROUNDS REMAIN! The gas vents! The clock ticks! MOVE, GLADIATORS!"
- First keycard acquired: "They have the RED KEYCARD! But TWO MORE await! Can they do it?!"
- Round 10: "FIVE ROUNDS! The gas THICKENS! Desperation or determination?!"
- Trap triggered: "BLADES! DARTS! GEARS! The arena does not forgive mistakes!"
- Round 15 (if still inside): "FINAL LOCKDOWN! The doors SEAL! It's over—wait, ARE THEY THROUGH?!"
- Victory: "They've ESCAPED! Seconds to spare! The lockdown DEFEATED! TARSUS ERUPTS!"

## GM Tips

- **Visible Timer:** Use a physical or digital countdown timer visible to all players. Announce remaining rounds frequently.
- **Encourage Splitting Up:** Allow PCs to divide tasks (one team handles Chamber 1, another scouts Chamber 2). Increases tension and efficiency.
- **Fair Warnings:** Before Round 10, remind players of the time pressure ("Gas is thickening—5 rounds left!").
- **Dynamic Descriptions:** Describe the arena's automation vividly—gears grinding, steam hissing, lights flashing red.
- **Trap Fairness:** Give clear clues for each trap (riddles, notes, visual patterns). Make failure costly but not instant death.
- **Emergency Clutch:** If PCs are 1 round short, consider letting them make a final desperate Athletics/Acrobatics check (DC 18) to dive through the closing door.
- **Reward Creativity:** If PCs use unexpected solutions (*stone shape* to stop gears, *passwall* to bypass corridors), reward them with Favor.

## Aftermath Seeds

- **Patron Interest:** Security firm impressed by PC's escape skills; offers contract for prison break or infiltration missions.
- **Rumor:** The lockdown protocol was **intentionally triggered** by a saboteur. Arena management launches investigation; PCs may be questioned or hired to help.
- **Downtime:** Keycards can be kept as trophies. Each functions as a **one-use Knock spell** (usable on doors/locks matching the keycard's color theme).
- **Injury:** PC caught in blade trap or crushed by gears develops a limp (disadvantage on Dexterity saves for 1d4 days, or until magical healing).
- **Political:** Arena sponsors debate whether the lockdown was "too dangerous." Some call for PCs to be compensated; others demand a rematch.
- **Loot:** In Chamber 3, hidden in a collapsed tile (Investigation DC 16), PCs find a **Potion of Speed** and **500 gp** (emergency supplies left by previous escapees).
