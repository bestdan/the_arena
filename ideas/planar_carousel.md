# Planar Carousel

- **Hook:** "FOUR WORLDS! ONE BATTLE! Can they adapt—or perish?" The arena rotates through four distinct elemental planes in a repeating cycle. Every 2 rounds, reality shifts—Fire to Water to Earth to Air and back again. The crowd watches through arcane scrying portals as gladiators fight the same enemies across four different worlds. Each plane offers unique dangers and advantages; positioning is everything.
- **Party:** 4-6 PCs, level 5+. Tests adaptability, resource management across environments, and tactical positioning to exploit plane-specific advantages.

## Opening Presentation
- Before combat starts, arena announcer presents all four planes in rapid succession (15 seconds each):
  - "Behold the PLANE OF FIRE—molten rivers, scorching winds!"
  - "Now WATER—crushing depths, drowning darkness!"
  - "EARTH rises—crushing stone, treacherous sinkholes!"
  - "And finally, AIR—weightless void, endless falls!"
- Large scrying screens show miniature versions of each plane simultaneously during combat.
- PCs know the rotation order: Fire → Water → Earth → Air → repeat.

## Arena Layout (120-foot diameter, transforms each shift)

### Plane of Fire (Rounds 1-2, 9-10, 17-18)
- Floor of obsidian glass with rivers of lava (20-foot-wide streams crisscrossing arena).
- **Heat Aura:** All creatures take 1d6 fire damage at start of their turn (resistance applies).
- **Lava Hazard:** Entering lava = 6d10 fire damage, Dex DC 15 to jump across narrow points.
- **Cover:** Three volcanic rock formations (10 feet tall, provide full cover).
- **Advantage:** Fire immunity/resistance negates heat aura; fire-based attacks deal +1d6 damage.
- **Disadvantage:** Cold-based attacks at disadvantage; ice spells melt immediately (no *wall of ice*).

### Plane of Water (Rounds 3-4, 11-12, 19-20)
- Submerged chamber with air pockets in giant bubbles (20-foot diameter, float at random heights).
- **Drowning Risk:** Creatures without swim speed or water breathing must hold breath (1 + Con mod minutes).
- **Water Current:** Strong currents pull toward center maelstrom (Strength DC 13 or move 10 feet involuntarily).
- **Cover:** Coral formations and kelp forests (half cover, difficult terrain).
- **Advantage:** Swim speed = full mobility; lightning spells in water affect 10-foot radius around target.
- **Disadvantage:** Fire spells deal half damage; non-piercing weapon attacks at disadvantage.

### Plane of Earth (Rounds 5-6, 13-14, 21-22)
- Solid stone floor with tremors causing pillars to rise/fall unpredictably.
- **Tremors:** At initiative 15, all creatures make Dex DC 14 save or fall prone; difficult terrain.
- **Sinkholes:** Three 10-foot-radius sinkholes (DC 15 Dex save or fall 20 feet, 2d6 bludgeoning).
- **Stone Pillars:** Five pillars randomly rise (10-20 feet tall) or sink each round, changing battlefield.
- **Cover:** Stone outcroppings (full cover, but can be destroyed by tremors).
- **Advantage:** Burrowing speed useful; thunder/bludgeoning damage ignores resistance on this plane.
- **Disadvantage:** Flying creatures have nowhere to land; lightning spells grounded (disadvantage on spell attack).

### Plane of Air (Rounds 7-8, 15-16, 23-24)
- Floating platforms (10-foot squares) suspended in open sky; 60-foot fall between platforms.
- **Updrafts:** Strong winds (DC 13 Strength save or pushed 10 feet in random direction at initiative 10).
- **Falling Risk:** Falling between platforms = 6d6 bludgeoning damage, land on random platform.
- **Platforms:** Eight platforms at varying heights (staggered 10-20 feet apart vertically).
- **Cover:** Floating debris and cloud banks (half cover, move with wind).
- **Advantage:** Flying speed = superior mobility; ranged attacks gain +10 feet range (thin air).
- **Disadvantage:** Grounded creatures struggle (jump DC 15 Athletics to reach adjacent platform).

## Planar Shift Mechanic
- **At Initiative Count 20 on rounds 2, 4, 6, 8, etc.:** Reality shimmers, plane shifts.
- **Transition Effect (1 round warning):** At initiative count 10 the round BEFORE shift, announcer shouts warning: "The planes TURN! Brace yourselves!"
- **Positioning Matters:** PCs near lava when shifting to Water = safe. PCs in water when shifting to Air = fall from platform.
- **Enemy Adaptation:** Enemies gain plane-specific buffs (see below).
- **Environmental Carryover:** Some conditions persist briefly (on fire = still burning in Water for 1 round, then extinguishes).

## Enemies (planar-touched mercenaries, 4 cycles through all planes)

### Core Enemies (present in all planes, adapt as shifts occur)
- **Salamander Champion** (CR 5; gains fire immunity in Fire plane, deals extra 2d6 fire damage).
  - Fire Plane: +10 HP, fire aura 10-foot radius (1d6 fire/turn).
  - Water Plane: Disadvantage on attacks, speed reduced by 10.
  - Earth Plane: Normal stats.
  - Air Plane: Can't fly, disadvantage on ranged attacks.
  
- **Marid Enforcer** (CR 5; gains swim speed 60 feet and water breathing in Water plane).
  - Fire Plane: Vulnerability to fire, -10 HP.
  - Water Plane: +10 HP, *control water* 1/day, advantage on all attacks.
  - Earth Plane: Normal stats but slowed (speed 20 feet).
  - Air Plane: Normal stats.

- **Dao Brute** (CR 7; gains tremor sense 60 feet in Earth plane, burrow speed 30 feet).
  - Fire Plane: Resistance to fire damage.
  - Water Plane: Speed reduced by 10, disadvantage on Dex saves.
  - Earth Plane: +20 HP, burrow speed, advantage on attack rolls, *earth tremor* at will.
  - Air Plane: Can't fly, falls prone when updrafts occur.

- **Djinni Skirmisher** (CR 5; gains fly speed 90 feet in Air plane).
  - Fire Plane: Normal stats.
  - Water Plane: Can create whirlpools (Strength DC 14 or pulled 15 feet).
  - Earth Plane: Grounded, fly speed reduced to 30 feet.
  - Air Plane: +10 HP, fly speed 90, advantage on ranged attacks, *gust of wind* at will.

### Additional Enemies (summoned/appear based on plane)
- **Fire Plane:** 2 Magma Mephits (CR 1/4; explode on death, create lava pools).
- **Water Plane:** 1 Water Elemental (CR 5; whelm ability, reforms if "killed" in water).
- **Earth Plane:** 1 Earth Elemental (CR 5; siege damage, earth glide).
- **Air Plane:** 1 Air Elemental (CR 5; whirlwind form, creates updrafts).

**Flex:** For 4 PCs, remove one planar champion (Salamander or Marid). For 6 PCs, add 1 Invisible Stalker (CR 6) in Air plane and 1 Xorn (CR 5) in Earth plane.

## Strategic Positioning
- **Pre-Shift Planning:** Smart PCs track rotation and position themselves advantageously:
  - "Fire is next—get near water to cool off!"
  - "Air is coming—get to high ground before platforms appear!"
  - "Earth shift soon—avoid sinkhole zones!"
  
- **Enemy Exploitation:** Enemies know the rotation and try to drag PCs into hazards:
  - Salamander pushes PCs toward lava before Water shift (they'll be safe, but waste turns repositioning).
  - Marid grapples PCs in Water, releases when Earth shift approaches (sinkholes).
  - Dao readies action to shove PCs off platforms when Air shift occurs.

## Crowd Favor Hooks
- Survive all four planes without taking environmental damage: +3 [[crowds_favor|Favor]] for perfect adaptation.
- Kill an enemy using their opposing element (Salamander in Water, Marid in Fire): +2 Favor for poetic justice.
- Exploit plane-specific advantage dramatically (surf lava on shield, ride updraft to platform, tunnel through earth): +2 Favor for creativity.
- Rescue ally from plane-specific hazard (drowning in Water, falling in Air, burning in Fire, sinkhole in Earth): +2 Favor per rescue.
- Position perfectly pre-shift to gain tactical advantage: +1 Favor for strategic thinking.
- [[panache|Panache]] strike that kills enemy right as plane shifts (timing): +3 Favor for dramatic timing.
- Use a plane-specific spell to devastating effect (*control water* in Water, *earthquake* in Earth, *fly* in Air, *fireball* in Fire): +2 Favor.
- Never fall prone despite tremors and updrafts: +2 Favor for perfect balance.

## Announcer Beats
- **Opening:** "PLANAR CAROUSEL! Four worlds collide! Will they master each—or die trying?!"
- **First shift (Fire → Water):** "REALITY BENDS! Flames become flood! The arena DROWNS!"
- **Water → Earth:** "The waters SOLIDIFY! Stone rises! The earth ROARS!"
- **Earth → Air:** "Gravity FAILS! They fall into SKY! Platforms scatter like leaves!"
- **Air → Fire (full cycle):** "THE WHEEL TURNS AGAIN! Fire returns! Will they ENDURE?!"
- **Enemy adaptation:** "The Salamander BLAZES in its home plane! It grows STRONGER!"
- **Strategic positioning:** "She positions herself! She KNOWS what's coming! Brilliant!"
- **Environmental kill:** "He shoves the Marid into FIRE! It SCREAMS as it burns!"
- **Victory:** "They've conquered FOUR WORLDS! The planes bow before them! LEGENDARY!"

## GM Tips
- **Visual Tracking:** Use different colored maps/mats for each plane, swap them physically or use VTT layers.
- **Countdown:** Announce shifts loudly at initiative 10 the round before: "SHIFT NEXT ROUND!"
- **Positioning Memory:** Track where PCs are when shift occurs—lava river = open water = stone ground = empty air.
- **Enemy Buffs:** Pre-calculate stat changes for each plane on enemy cards for quick reference.
- **Environmental Drama:** Narrate shifts viscerally: "Lava solidifies under your feet—becomes crushing stone!"
- **Learning Curve:** First cycle is chaos; by second cycle, PCs should strategize pre-shifts.
- **Plane-Specific Tactics:** Encourage creative use of environment (extinguish fire in Water, use tremors to knock enemies into sinkholes).
- **Rotation Reminder:** Display order visibly (Fire → Water → Earth → Air) and cross off completed rounds.

## Aftermath Seeds
- **Planar Echoes:** PCs who survived all four planes gain "Planar Touched" trait—advantage on saves vs. teleportation/planar effects, but attract planar creatures (recognition).
- **Patron Interest:** Archmage fascinated by "planar stability under stress"; offers sponsorship for expedition to actual elemental planes (deadly contract).
- **Rumor:** The planar carousel was powered by stolen elemental keystones—four cults seek their return, will pay handsomely or threaten PCs.
- **Downtime:** Arena mages offer "Planar Attunement" training—spend 5 downtime days to gain resistance to one element (player choice, requires surviving that plane).
- **Injury:** PC who fell in Air plane develops fear of heights (disadvantage on saves vs. falling effects, roleplaying).
- **Legendary Moment:** If PCs executed perfect pre-shift positioning 3+ times, crowd demands encore performance; future planar bouts pay double.
- **Political:** Rival arena attempts to copy planar carousel, fails catastrophically (deaths); PCs' arena gains prestige as "the only stable planar venue."
- **Loot:** Each elemental champion drops a token (Flame Heart, Water Pearl, Earth Shard, Air Feather)—collecting all four unlocks powerful elemental weapon/armor in downtime.
