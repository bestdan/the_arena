# The Alchemist's Trial

- **Hook:** A mad alchemist has transformed the arena into a deadly laboratory. Five reagents are scattered across hazardous zones—each guarded, each volatile. Gather all five and brew the **Elixir of Victory** at the central cauldron before the toxic miasma consumes you. Mix them wrong, and the explosion will be... spectacular.
- **Party:** 4-6 PCs, level 5+. Emphasize resource gathering under pressure, risk management, and alchemical puzzle-solving.

## Arena Layout
- Pentagonal arena (120 feet edge-to-edge) with **5 Reagent Zones** at each corner, each containing a unique alchemical ingredient.
- **Central Cauldron** (massive iron pot, 10 feet diameter, bubbling with green liquid) at the arena's heart—the brewing site.
- **Miasma Cloud** (toxic fog) slowly spreads from arena edges inward (see Hazards).
- Terrain varies by zone:
  - **Fire Zone** (southeast): lava pools, charred ground, flaming pillars.
  - **Ice Zone** (northeast): frozen floor (difficult terrain), icicle stalactites.
  - **Acid Zone** (north): bubbling pools, corroded stone, dripping stalactites.
  - **Lightning Zone** (southwest): electrified metal plates, Tesla coils sparking.
  - **Poison Zone** (northwest): toxic fumes, sickly green vegetation, slime puddles.
- Crowd watches from behind protective barriers (alchemist's explosions are notoriously unpredictable).

## Core Mechanic: Reagent Gathering & Brewing
The arena contains **5 Reagent Zones**, each holding one critical ingredient. PCs must gather all five and combine them at the Central Cauldron.

### Reagent Locations
Each zone contains **one reagent** stored in a fragile container (glass vial, crystal flask, or enchanted cage):
1. **Fire Zone:** *Phoenix Ash* (glowing red powder; contained in heat-resistant vial; guarded by Fire Elementals).
2. **Ice Zone:** *Frost Lily* (frozen blue flower; encased in ice block; guarded by Ice Mephits).
3. **Acid Zone:** *Basilisk Scale* (green-black scale; floating in acid pool; guarded by Ochre Jelly).
4. **Lightning Zone:** *Storm Core* (crackling orb; held in Faraday cage; guarded by Lightning Elemental).
5. **Poison Zone:** *Viper's Tear* (purple liquid; sealed in glass ampule; guarded by Poisonous Snakes).

### Reagent Collection
- Each reagent requires **1 action** to collect (reach container, carefully extract reagent).
- **Risk:** Containers are **fragile** (AC 10, 5 HP). If damaged by attack or fall, reagent is destroyed (cannot brew Elixir without all five).
- PCs carrying reagents must protect them (if PC takes 15+ damage in one hit, Dex save DC 13 or reagent shatters).
- Reagents are **volatile**—mixing them prematurely (carrying multiple without brewing) risks explosion (see Hazards).

### Brewing the Elixir
- Once all five reagents are gathered, PCs must bring them to the **Central Cauldron**.
- One PC must perform the **Brewing Ritual** (requires **2 actions** total; can be split across multiple PCs or one PC over 2 rounds).
  - Action 1: Add reagents in **correct order** (Intelligence [Arcana] DC 15 to deduce order; failure = minor explosion, 2d6 fire damage in 10-foot radius).
  - Action 2: Stir and complete ritual (requires concentration; if interrupted, must restart).
- **Correct Order:** Fire → Ice → Lightning → Acid → Poison (represents elemental balance: heat, cold, energy, corrosion, toxin).
- **Incorrect Order:** Cauldron explodes (4d6 fire + 2d6 poison damage in 20-foot radius; reagents destroyed; must re-gather).

### Victory Condition
- Upon completing the Brewing Ritual correctly, the **Elixir of Victory** manifests (glowing golden liquid).
- One PC must drink the Elixir (action) to trigger arena victory (gates open, guardians deactivate, miasma dissipates).
- **Effect of Elixir:** PC who drinks gains temporary immunity to all damage for 1 minute (ceremonial; doesn't affect combat much since bout ends immediately).

## Enemies (Elemental Guardians)
Each zone is guarded by creatures aligned with that element. They **defend reagents** and attack PCs who enter their zone.

### 4 PCs
- **Fire Zone:** 2 Fire Elementals (CR 5, reduced HP to 60 each).
- **Ice Zone:** 4 Ice Mephits (CR 1/4).
- **Acid Zone:** 1 Ochre Jelly (CR 2).
- **Lightning Zone:** 1 Air Elemental (reskin as Lightning Elemental; CR 5, reduced HP to 60).
- **Poison Zone:** 6 Poisonous Snakes (CR 1/8).

### 5 PCs
- **Fire Zone:** 2 Fire Elementals (CR 5, HP 70 each).
- **Ice Zone:** 5 Ice Mephits.
- **Acid Zone:** 1 Ochre Jelly + 1 Gray Ooze (CR 1/2).
- **Lightning Zone:** 1 Lightning Elemental (HP 70).
- **Poison Zone:** 8 Poisonous Snakes + 1 Giant Poisonous Snake (CR 1/4).

### 6 PCs
- **Fire Zone:** 3 Fire Elementals (CR 5, HP 80 each).
- **Ice Zone:** 6 Ice Mephits.
- **Acid Zone:** 1 Black Pudding (CR 4).
- **Lightning Zone:** 1 Lightning Elemental (HP 80) + 2 Shock Sprites (reskin Sprites; zap for lightning damage).
- **Poison Zone:** 10 Poisonous Snakes + 1 Yuan-ti Pureblood (CR 1; uses poison spells).

### Enemy Tactics
- **Fire Elementals** ignite flammable objects; try to corner PCs near lava pools.
- **Ice Mephits** use frost breath to slow PCs (difficult terrain from ice); swarm reagent carrier.
- **Ochre Jelly / Black Pudding** split when damaged by slashing/lightning; block access to Basilisk Scale.
- **Lightning Elemental** targets metal-wearing PCs; electrifies metal plates to create hazards.
- **Snakes / Yuan-ti** hide in toxic fumes; strike from ambush; poison damage over time.

## Objectives
- **Primary:** Gather all five reagents from the five elemental zones.
- **Secondary:** Brew the Elixir of Victory at the Central Cauldron using the correct order.
- **Tertiary:** Complete the trial before the Miasma Cloud reaches the Central Cauldron (Round 12).
- **Bonus:** Protect all reagents (no shattering) and brew Elixir on first attempt (no explosions).

## Tactical Elements
- **Zone Specialization:** Each zone has unique hazards and guardians; PCs may want to split up (faster) or stay together (safer).
- **Reagent Fragility:** Carrying reagents is risky; PCs must protect carriers or risk losing critical ingredients.
- **Brewing Knowledge:** Deducing correct reagent order requires Intelligence check or trial-and-error (explosion punishes mistakes).
- **Time Pressure:** Miasma Cloud advances each round; creates urgency to gather and brew quickly.
- **Voluntary Mixing Risk:** Carrying multiple reagents increases explosion risk; PCs may want to relay reagents to cauldron one at a time (safer but slower).

## Hazards and Twists
- **Miasma Cloud:** Toxic fog spreads from arena edges inward (10 feet per round). PCs inside cloud take 2d6 poison damage at start of their turn (Constitution save DC 13 for half). Cloud reaches Central Cauldron at **Round 12** (if Elixir not brewed by then, miasma overwhelms arena; all PCs take 6d6 poison damage per round until they escape or die).
- **Zone Hazards:**
  - **Fire Zone:** Lava pools (10x10 feet; 3d6 fire damage if entered; jump across with Athletics DC 12).
  - **Ice Zone:** Frozen floor (difficult terrain; Dex save DC 11 or fall prone when moving more than half speed).
  - **Acid Zone:** Acid pools (10x10 feet; 2d6 acid damage if entered; corrodes metal items).
  - **Lightning Zone:** Electrified plates (metal floor sections; 2d8 lightning damage if touched; Perception DC 13 to spot before stepping).
  - **Poison Zone:** Toxic fumes (lightly obscured; disadvantage on Perception checks; breathing fumes = Constitution save DC 12 or poisoned for 1 minute).
- **Volatile Reagents:** If a PC carries **2+ reagents simultaneously**, they must make Dex save DC 14 at end of each turn or reagents explode (3d6 fire + 2d6 poison damage; reagents destroyed).
- **Cauldron Explosion:** Brewing with incorrect reagent order causes explosion (4d6 fire + 2d6 poison in 20-foot radius; all reagents lost; must re-gather).
- **Round 8 Twist:** Alchemist's voice echoes: "Mix them wrong and BOOM! Mix them RIGHT and glory! Choose wisely!" (psychological pressure; no mechanical effect).
- **False Reagent (Optional):** One zone contains a **decoy reagent** (looks real but is inert; Arcana DC 15 to identify as fake). Using it in Elixir causes failure.

## Crowd Favor Hooks
- First PC to collect a reagent: +1 [[crowds_favor|Favor]].
- Collect a reagent without taking damage in that zone: +1 Favor per reagent.
- Successfully navigate a zone hazard with [[panache|Panache]] (e.g., leap over lava pool, slide across ice): +1 Favor.
- Protect a reagent from shattering after taking heavy damage (successful Dex save): +2 Favor for clutch save.
- Brew the Elixir with correct order on first attempt: +3 Favor for alchemical mastery.
- Complete trial before Round 10 (before miasma becomes severe): +2 Favor for speed.
- Survive zone hazards with style (creative use of spells, abilities): +1 Favor.

## Announcer Beats
- Opening: "The cauldron BUBBLES! Five reagents, five zones, five chances to EXPLODE! **Can they brew victory or blow themselves to DUST?!**"
- First reagent collected: "They have the Phoenix Ash! One down, four to go! But the MIASMA approaches!"
- Zone hazard triggered: "LAVA! ICE! ACID! The arena itself is a weapon! Survive the elements!"
- Reagent shattered: "NO! The vial BREAKS! Can they recover?! Time is RUNNING OUT!"
- Brewing begins: "They mix the reagents! Will they get it RIGHT?! The crowd holds its breath!"
- Incorrect order (explosion): "BOOM! Wrong order! The cauldron EXPLODES! Tarsus shakes! Try again, alchemists!"
- Correct Elixir brewed: "THE ELIXIR GLOWS! Golden light! They've DONE IT! Drink and claim VICTORY!"
- Victory: "They conquered the TRIAL! Elements bent to will! Alchemy over chaos! **Tarsus roars for the master brewers!**"

## GM Tips
- **Pre-Prep Reagents:** Write reagent descriptions on index cards or handouts (players can track what they've collected).
- **Zone Descriptions:** Make each zone visually distinct (fire = red/orange lighting, ice = blue/white, acid = green, lightning = electric blue, poison = sickly purple).
- **Miasma Tracking:** Use a visible timer or token advancing on map (10 feet per round). Announce "Miasma spreads!" each round.
- **Reagent Fragility:** Remind players reagents can shatter (create tension when carriers take damage). Narrate near-misses ("The vial teeters in your hand—*careful!*").
- **Brewing Order Clues:** Drop subtle hints (alchemical texts in Fire Zone mention "heat first," Ice Zone mentions "cool the flame," etc.). Let clever PCs deduce order.
- **Explosion Drama:** When cauldron explodes (wrong order), describe it vividly—"Green flames ERUPT! Shockwave throws you back! Reagents LOST!"
- **Elemental Guardians:** Describe guardians as extensions of their zones (Fire Elementals = living flame, Ice Mephits = giggling frost sprites).
- **Voluntary Mixing Risk:** Warn players if they're carrying multiple reagents ("You feel the vials heating up—they're not meant to be together!").
- **Victory Elixir:** When PC drinks Elixir, describe transformation—"Golden light floods your veins! Invincibility surges! You are UNTOUCHABLE!" (even though bout ends immediately).

## Aftermath Seeds
- **Patron Interest:** Alchemist's Guild impressed by brewing skills; offers contract to create potions, poisons, or experimental compounds.
- **Rumor:** The Elixir of Victory is more than ceremonial—some say it grants **true immortality** if brewed outside the arena (leads to side quest to gather reagents in the wild).
- **Downtime:** PC who drank the Elixir gains **Alchemical Resistance** (resistance to poison damage for 1 week; body still carries traces of the brew).
- **Injury:** PC who suffered cauldron explosion develops **Chemical Burns** (disadvantage on Charisma checks for 1d4 days due to visible scarring; removable via *lesser restoration*).
- **Political:** Crowd debates riskiest gathering strategy ("They split up! Brave!" vs. "They stayed together! Smart!"). Patrons favor bold vs. cautious playstyles differently.
- **Loot:** Leftover reagents (if any) can be sold as **Elemental Essences** (100 gp each; useful for crafting potions or enchanting items).
- **Secret:** Central Cauldron contains residue from previous trials—**Elixir Residue** (can be harvested; grants one-time advantage on next Alchemist's Tools check; 50 gp value).
