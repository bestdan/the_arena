# Breach at the Gates

- **Hook:** The arena transforms into a fortified checkpoint. Waves of "invaders" pour from the north gate, desperate to reach the south gate and "escape to freedom." The gladiators must hold the line. Let too many through, and the crowd jeers your failure. Hold strong, and glory is yours.
- **Party:** 4-6 PCs, level 3-4. Emphasizes positioning, area control, and tactical sacrifice.

## Arena Layout
- 80-foot corridor between North Gate (enemy spawn) and South Gate (breach point).
- Central chokepoint with barricades (half-cover, can be reinforced or destroyed).
- Side alcoves (10×10 feet each) with weapon racks and sand pits (difficult terrain).
- Two 15-foot-high watchtowers flank the center, accessible by ladders (can rain arrows or jump down for dramatic saves).
- Braziers positioned every 20 feet; can be tipped for area denial (10-foot square, 2d6 fire, Dex DC 13).

## Attrition Mechanics
- **Breach Limit:** If **7 or more enemies** reach the South Gate, the defense fails catastrophically (no Favor earned, crowd boos).
- **Graduated Rewards:**
  - 0 breaches: +4 Favor to all defenders, bonus patron attention.
  - 1-2 breaches: +3 Favor to all defenders.
  - 3-4 breaches: +2 Favor to all defenders.
  - 5-6 breaches: +1 Favor to all defenders, crowd grows restless.
  - 7+ breaches: Defense fails; lose 1 Favor each, patrons lose interest.
- **Enemy Goal:** Enemies prioritize movement over combat. They use Dash actions to sprint for the gate unless engaged in melee or heavily damaged.

## Waves (12 rounds total)
**Round 1-4 - The Desperate Rabble:**
- 8 Bandits (CR 1/8) arrive in pairs every round. Low HP but fast; use Dash frequently.
- Flex: 4 PCs = 6 Bandits total. 6 PCs = 10 Bandits total.

**Round 5-8 - The Coordinated Push:**
- 4 Thugs (CR 1/2) emerge, two per round. Tougher, use pack tactics when they can.
- 2 Scouts (CR 1/2) appear on Round 5 and 7, use Cunning Action to Dash/Disengage.
- 1 Priest (CR 2) on Round 6 casts *bless* on nearby runners, then attempts to slip through.
- Flex: 4 PCs = remove 1 Thug and the Priest. 6 PCs = add 1 Veteran (CR 3) on Round 8.

**Round 9-12 - The Final Surge:**
- 2 Berserkers (CR 2) charge in on Round 9, attempting to clear a path for others.
- 4 Goblins (CR 1/4) swarm from side passages on Round 10, using Nimble Escape to slip past.
- 1 Ogre (CR 2) lumbers through on Round 11, attempting to bull rush through defenders.
- Flex: 4 PCs = remove Ogre, add 2 more Thugs. 6 PCs = Ogre gains a Goblin Boss rider throwing javelins.

## Objectives
- **Primary:** Prevent 7 or more enemies from breaching the South Gate.
- **Secondary:** Earn Crowd Favor based on breach count (see Attrition Mechanics).
- **Bonus:** No PC falls unconscious during the defense (+1 Favor to all).

## Crowd Favor Hooks
- Stop an enemy one square from the gate with a killing blow: +2 Favor.
- Use environment to stop multiple enemies at once (tipped brazier, collapsing barricade): +2 Favor.
- Intercept a runner with an opportunity attack that drops them: +1 Favor.
- Declare a [[panache_mechanics|Panache]] strike to defend the gate and succeed: +2 Favor.
- Save an overwhelmed ally from being bypassed: +1 Favor to both.
- Hold the center chokepoint solo for a full round while enemies try to pass: +2 Favor.

## Hazards and Terrain
- **Barricades:** Provide half-cover. Can be reinforced (action, AC +2) or destroyed by enemies (15 HP, AC 12).
- **Braziers:** Tip as action; creates 10-foot fire square lasting 3 rounds.
- **Sand Pits:** Difficult terrain; creatures starting turn there make DC 12 Dex save or grant advantage on attacks against them.
- **Watchtowers:** Grant height advantage (+2 to ranged attacks). Jumping down on enemy = DC 12 Acrobatics or take 1d6; on success, can knock enemy prone (Strength contest).

## Announcer Beats
- Opening: "The gates are under siege! How many will slip past our champions? The wager is set—seven breaches and they FAIL!"
- Round 5: "The rabble becomes a tide! Coordination! Discipline! Can our defenders adapt?"
- First breach: "One through! The crowd groans! Hold the line, gladiators!"
- Round 9: "The Berserkers come! Blood and fury! The final test begins!"
- Near-breach save: "A desperate lunge! A killing strike! DENIED at the threshold!"
- Victory (0-2 breaches): "The gates hold! Tarsus roars for its champions! IMPENETRABLE!"
- Defeat (7+ breaches): "The line crumbles! The gates are lost! Shame in the sands!"

## GM Tips
- Track breaches on a visible counter; build tension as count approaches 7.
- Remind players enemies will Dash unless engaged; reward area control and crowd control abilities.
- If defenders struggle, have announcer "accidentally" drop inspiration to one PC via crowd throw.
- Enemies should shout and point toward the gate; create urgency with descriptions of their desperation.
- Consider letting wounded enemies flee toward the gate instead of fighting to death for added pressure.
- If a PC uses [[last_stand|Last Stand]], have the announcer go wild; +3 Favor for the dramatic sacrifice.

## Aftermath Seeds
- **Perfect Defense (0 breaches):** Military patron offers sponsorship; "I need soldiers like you on the border."
- **Close Call (5-6 breaches):** Crowd whispers about "nearly breaking"; rival gladiators mock them in taverns.
- **Breach Counter:** Each PC gains a tally mark tattoo or scar for every enemy that got through; badge of shame or honor depending on final count.
- **Rumor:** The "invaders" were actually prisoners from a recent border raid; some in crowd recognize them, creating political tension.
- **Downtime:** Weapon merchant offers area control tools: caltrops, nets, tanglefoot bags at discount.
