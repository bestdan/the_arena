# Wild Surge Arena

- **Hook:** Patrons unleash unstable wild magic across the sands—each spell risks a surge. Wizards' colleges bet on who controls the chaos. The crowd screams as fireballs bloom into sheep, and healing surges into lightning.
- **Party:** 4-6 PCs, level 5+. At least one spellcaster heavily encouraged. Wild magic punishes and rewards in equal measure.

## Arena Layout
- Open pit (100-foot diameter) with minimal cover—three stone obelisks (15 feet tall, provide full cover) positioned in a triangle.
- Arcane Ley Lines crisscross the floor (visible as glowing blue veins); casting a spell while standing on a ley line triggers Wild Magic on a d20 roll of 1-5 (instead of just 1).
- Central Chaos Font (20-foot-radius sphere of roiling arcane energy, 10 feet above ground): any spell cast while within or targeting into the Font automatically triggers Wild Magic Surge.
- Crowd-facing: Large scry-screens above arena show surge effects in slow-motion for maximum drama.

## Wild Magic Rules (Enhanced)
- **All spellcasters** use Wild Magic Surge table (PHB page 104 or expanded homebrew).
- Trigger conditions:
  - Natural 1 on spell attack roll: surge.
  - Standing on ley line when casting (1-5 on d20): surge.
  - Casting into or within Chaos Font: automatic surge.
  - Enemy Chaos Conduit's aura (see below): surge on 1-10 on d20.
- Track surges visually; crowd reacts to each one with cheers/gasps depending on effect.

## Enemies (chaos-touched)
- 2 Chaos Conduits (reskin Cult Fanatic; have innate *chaos bolt* at will, aura extends wild magic trigger range to 1-10 on d20 for all casters within 30 feet).
- 3 Wild-Warped Archers (use Scout; arrows carry random elemental damage—roll d6 each hit for fire/cold/lightning/acid/poison/thunder).
- 1 Unstable Elemental (reskin Air Elemental; changes element type each surge within 60 feet—cycles through fire/water/earth/air, resistances and damage type shift accordingly).
- 2 Arcane Constructs (reskin Animated Armor; explode in 10-foot-radius wild magic burst when destroyed—all nearby casters surge).
- **Flex:** For 4 PCs, remove 1 Chaos Conduit and 1 Wild-Warped Archer. For 6 PCs, add 1 more Unstable Elemental and give Chaos Conduits *counterspell* (1/day each).

## Tactical Elements
- **Ley Line Gambit:** High risk/reward—ley lines grant +1 to spell attack rolls and save DCs, but increase surge chance.
- **Chaos Font:** Avoid or exploit—spells cast into it automatically surge but deal maximum damage if surge effect is benign.
- **Surge Synergy:** Clever PCs can position enemies near allies, hoping for beneficial surges (healing, buffs) or detrimental ones to enemies (fireballs, polymorphs).
- **Constructs as Bombs:** Bait enemies into killing Constructs to trigger surges near them.

## Crowd Favor Hooks
- Trigger a Wild Magic Surge that benefits the party (healing, advantage buff): +1 Favor.
- Trigger a surge that harms enemies dramatically (fireball, *polymorph* into sheep): +2 Favor.
- Survive a detrimental surge and still land the killing blow on an enemy: +2 Favor for resilience.
- Deliberately cast into the Chaos Font for maximum damage: +1 Favor for audacity.
- Turn an Unstable Elemental's element against it (surge changes it to fire, PC immediately exploits vulnerability): +1 Favor for quick thinking.
- Complete the fight without triggering a single Wild Magic Surge (non-casters only): +1 Favor for playing it safe.

## Sample Wild Magic Chaos (Expanded Table Highlights)
1. Caster grows a beard of feathers (cosmetic, crowd laughs).
2. Next spell regains its spell slot immediately.
3. *Fireball* centered on self (8d6, Dex save).
4. Caster's skin turns bright blue for 24 hours (crowd favorite).
5. Summon a unicorn that aids the caster for 1 minute.
6. Teleport up to 60 feet to a random unoccupied space (could be into danger).
7. All creatures within 30 feet grow one size category for 1 minute.
8. Caster gains *fly* speed 60 feet for 1 minute.

## Hazards and Environment
- **Ley Lines:** +1 to spell attack/DC, but surge on 1-5 on d20.
- **Chaos Font:** Auto-surge, max damage on attack spells if surge is cosmetic/beneficial.
- **Unstable Elemental:** Changes type with nearby surges; track current form visually (fire, water, earth, air).
- **Arcane Constructs:** Explode on death—all casters within 10 feet surge.

## Announcer Beats
- Opening: "Step into the Wild Surge Arena, where magic itself has gone mad! Will they tame the tempest—or become its plaything?"
- First surge: "Reality fractures! The mage's *magic missile* becomes a flock of butterflies! The crowd erupts!"
- Chaos Font entered: "They dare the Font! Every spell a cataclysm! Every gesture a gamble!"
- Elemental shift: "The Elemental blazes—no, wait—it freezes! Ice spreads across the sands!"
- Climax: "Surges cascade! Spells ricochet! Who stands when the dust settles?!"

## GM Tips
- Pre-print Wild Magic Surge table or use digital roller for speed.
- Narrate each surge with flair—crowd reactions, visual spectacle, unexpected twists.
- Let non-casters feel useful: they can position, grapple casters off ley lines, or destroy Constructs tactically.
- If a surge is devastating to the party, let the crowd's [[crowds_favor|Favor]] grant a one-time reroll (spend 3 Favor collectively).
- Encourage casters to "lean into" surges—cast recklessly, embrace chaos, and the crowd will love it.
- Track Unstable Elemental's current type on a visible token or note; call out changes loudly.

## Aftermath Seeds
- Patron interest: Wild magic researcher offers to study PCs' surge patterns; grants experimental magic items.
- Rumor: The Chaos Font was stolen from a planar rift; cultists seek its return, will pay or threaten PCs.
- Downtime: Wizard guild offers training in "Controlled Chaos" (feat or boon granting limited surge manipulation).
- Lingering effect: PC who surged most gains "Wild-Touched" trait—random cosmetic changes (eye color shift, hair sparks, etc.) that fade over 1d4 days.
