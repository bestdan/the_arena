# The Ascending Abyss

- **Hook:** "UP OR DOWN? LIFE OR DEATH!" The arena floor opens to reveal a 100-foot-deep pit with platforms at multiple levels. Water floods from below, rising 10 feet every round. Flying enemies attack from above while climbers pursue from below. PCs must ascend to safety at the top while fighting on all sides—but some team members have climbing gear, others don't. Can they lift each other to safety before the water drowns them all?
- **Party:** 3-5 PCs. Tests vertical combat, climbing coordination, resource sharing, and panic management. Ultimate "rising water" pressure scenario.

## Arena Layout (Vertical Multi-Level)

**The Pit (100 feet deep, 60 feet diameter circular shaft):**
- **Bottom Level (0 feet):** Where PCs start, stone floor, initial safe zone—but water begins flooding immediately.
- **Platform Ring 1 (25 feet up):** Four stone platforms (10 feet × 10 feet) jutting from wall, 90 degrees apart.
- **Platform Ring 2 (50 feet up):** Three narrower platforms (8 feet × 8 feet), offset from Ring 1.
- **Platform Ring 3 (75 feet up):** Two small platforms (5 feet × 5 feet), barely enough room to stand.
- **Top Arena Floor (100 feet up):** Safety—once PCs reach this, they're out of danger from water.
- **Walls:** Rough stone, climbable (Athletics DC 13 without gear, DC 10 with climbing gear).

**Rising Water Mechanic:**
- Water starts at floor level (0 feet).
- Rises **10 feet per round** at initiative count 20 (losing all ties).
- **Swimming:** PCs in water must make DC 12 Athletics check to swim upward 5 feet per round (or 10 feet on critical success). Failure = no progress, swept down 5 feet by current.
- **Drowning:** PCs fully submerged must hold breath (Constitution score in rounds). Afterward, drop to 0 HP and begin death saves.
- **Announcement:** At initiative 20, announce new water level: "The water reaches 40 feet! Ring 1 platforms submerged!"

**Platform Timeline:**
- **Round 3 (30 feet):** Ring 1 platforms begin submerging (still usable but chest-deep water).
- **Round 5 (50 feet):** Ring 1 fully underwater, Ring 2 at water level.
- **Round 8 (80 feet):** Ring 2 submerged, Ring 3 at water level.
- **Round 10 (100 feet):** Entire pit filled—anyone not at top drowns.

## Asymmetric Equipment (Cooperation Required)

**Climbing Gear Distribution:**
- **2 PCs have climbing gear** (rope, pitons, harness)—can climb DC 10 and assist others.
- **Remaining PCs have NO gear**—must climb DC 13 or be assisted.

**Gear Benefits:**
- **Rope (50 feet):** Climber with gear can secure rope to platform (action), allowing allies to climb it with advantage.
- **Pitons:** Hammered into wall (action), creates permanent handhold (reduces DC by 2 for subsequent climbers).
- **Harness:** Can tie to ally and pull them up (Athletics check DC 10, hauling 1 PC costs full turn action).

**Coordination Mechanic:**
- Geared PCs should ascend first, secure ropes, then haul teammates.
- Ungeared PCs can attempt solo climb (risky) or wait for assistance (slower but safer).
- **Panic Risk:** Water rising creates urgency—PCs may rush and fall.

## Enemies (Three-Dimensional Threat)

### From Above (Flying):
- 3 **Harpies** (CR 1; flying speed 40 feet, luring song DC 11 Wisdom save or charmed—walk toward harpy, potentially off platform).
- 1 **Gargoyle** (CR 2; flying, divebomb attacks, false appearance—hides as statue on platforms).

### From Below (Climbers):
- 4 **Lizardfolk Climbers** (CR 1/2; climb speed 30 feet, javelin throws, bite attacks, pursue PCs up walls).
- 1 **Giant Octopus** (CR 1; appears when water reaches 30 feet, grapples PCs in water, pulls them under, ink cloud for concealment).

### From Sides (Platform Ambush):
- 2 **Bugbear Sentries** (CR 1; stationed on Ring 2 platforms, reach weapons, attempt to cut ropes PCs are climbing).

### 3 PCs Scaling:
- Remove 1 Harpy and Giant Octopus.
- Reduce Lizardfolk Climbers to 2.

### 4-5 PCs Scaling:
- Use full enemy roster.
- Add 1 **Merrow** (CR 2; amphibious, appears at Round 5 in water, harpoon attacks pull PCs into water).

### Enemy Tactics:
- **Harpies:** Fly above PCs, use luring song to cause falls; prioritize ungeared PCs (easier to kill).
- **Gargoyle:** Waits on platform, ambushes PCs when they land; uses false appearance to surprise.
- **Lizardfolk Climbers:** Chase PCs up walls, bite at heels, javelin from below (disadvantage on ranged attacks upward).
- **Giant Octopus:** Grapples swimming PCs (DC 14 to escape), drags them 10 feet deeper per round.
- **Bugbear Sentries:** Guard Ring 2 platforms, cut ropes (AC 10, 15 HP per rope), shove PCs off platforms (Athletics contest).

## Falling Hazard

**Falling Damage:**
- Standard D&D rules: 1d6 per 10 feet fallen.
- Falls from Ring 3 (75 feet) = 7d6 (average 24 damage).
- Falls from Ring 2 (50 feet) = 5d6 (average 17 damage).
- Falls from Ring 1 (25 feet) = 2d6 (average 7 damage).

**Landing in Water:**
- If water is at least 10 feet deep at landing point, reduce fall damage by 1d6 (water cushions).
- But now PC is swimming (must use Athletics to ascend).

**Climbing Failure:**
- Failing Athletics check by 5+ = fall.
- Allies can attempt to catch (DC 15 Dexterity save as reaction if within 5 feet).

## Objectives

- **Primary:** All PCs reach top arena floor (100 feet) before water fills pit (Round 10).
- **Secondary:** No PCs fall and take 20+ damage in a single instance.
- **Bonus:** Defeat all flying enemies before escaping (clears threat for crowd's satisfaction).

## Crowd Favor Hooks

- Successfully haul an ally up with rope/harness: +1 [[crowds_favor|Favor]] per rescue.
- Climb from bottom to top without falling (perfect ascent): +3 Favor for skill.
- Kill an enemy while climbing (attack while on wall): +2 Favor for daring.
- Catch a falling ally (reaction save): +2 Favor for heroism.
- Resist Harpy's luring song 3+ times: +1 Favor for discipline.
- Defeat Giant Octopus while in water (hard mode): +2 Favor for toughness.
- PC without climbing gear reaches top first (solo climb, no assistance): +3 Favor for independence.
- Secure rope on every platform ring (Ring 1, 2, 3) before escaping: +2 Favor for thoroughness.
- [[panache|Panache]] leap from Ring 3 to top (30-foot jump, DC 18 Athletics, fall if fail): +4 Favor if successful.
- Last PC reaches top on Round 9 or 10 (dramatic close call): +2 Favor for suspense.

## Climbing Coordination Strategies

**Optimal Strategy:**
1. **Round 1-2:** Geared PCs climb to Ring 1 (25 feet), secure ropes.
2. **Round 3-4:** Ungeared PCs climb ropes with advantage while geared PCs continue to Ring 2 (50 feet).
3. **Round 5-6:** Geared PCs secure Ring 2 ropes, haul stragglers from Ring 1.
4. **Round 7-8:** Team consolidates at Ring 2-3, final push to top.
5. **Round 9-10:** Everyone reaches safety.

**Risky Alternative:**
- All PCs attempt independent climbs (faster if successful, but falls likely).

**Panic Scenario:**
- If PC falls early, team must decide: rescue them (costs time) or leave them to climb alone (risks drowning).

## Environmental Hazards

**Crumbling Platforms:**
- Ring 1 platforms are old stone—each can support 500 pounds total.
- If exceeded (3+ Medium creatures + gear), DC 13 Dexterity save or platform collapses, all on it fall 25 feet into water.

**Slippery Walls:**
- Sections of wall have moss (DC +2 to climb, marked by green coloration).
- PCs can spot moss with Perception DC 12, avoid by climbing adjacent section.

**Water Pressure:**
- At Round 7+ (water above 60 feet), strong current pushes upward (Athletics DC +2 to swim).

## Announcer Beats

- Opening: "THE ABYSS OPENS! The water RISES! Can they ASCEND—or DROWN?!"
- Water reaches 10 feet: "The flood begins! Ankles wet! The climb is ON!"
- First PC falls: "They SLIP! Falling through air! CATCH THEM!"
- Harpy song: "The song! The LURE! Resist or plunge to your doom!"
- Rope secured: "A lifeline! Teamwork manifest! The rope holds—CLIMB!"
- Giant Octopus appears: "From the depths—TENTACLES! The water brings DEATH!"
- Platform collapse: "The stone CRUMBLES! Bodies fall! The abyss HUNGERS!"
- First PC reaches top: "ONE ESCAPES! But their allies still fight below! Will they abandon them?!"
- Last PC reaches top (Round 9-10): "The water at their heels! FINAL LUNGE! THEY MADE IT!"
- Defeat: "The water claims them! They fought gravity and lost! The abyss remembers!"

## GM Tips

- **Vertical Battle Map:** Use vertical cross-section map or stack multiple maps to show levels clearly.
- **Water Tracking:** Use blue tokens or overlay to show rising water level; move up 10 feet each round visibly.
- **Climbing Narration:** Describe physical struggle: "Your fingers grip wet stone, muscles burning, water splashing below..."
- **Panic Pacing:** Early rounds = calm planning. Round 5+ = urgent shouting, decisions under pressure.
- **Rope Mechanics:** Allow creative uses—swing across gap, lasso enemy and pull them off platform, etc.
- **Falling Drama:** When PC falls, slow-motion narrate: "You lose grip... weightless... falling..."
- **Enemy Priority:** Harpies should target PCs on narrow platforms (easier to push off). Octopus targets swimmers.
- **Crowd Reactions:** Crowd cheers when PC makes difficult climb, gasps at falls, roars at rope rescues.

## Tactical Elements

- **Speed vs. Safety:** Fast climbing (risky) vs. waiting for ropes (safe but slower).
- **Gear Priority:** Geared PCs are force multipliers—protect them so they can assist others.
- **Platform Defense:** Bugbear Sentries block Ring 2—must defeat or bypass them.
- **Flying Enemies:** Ranged attacks useful but have disadvantage when shooting upward; melee PCs must wait for enemies to dive.
- **Water as Cover:** Submerged PCs have half-cover against ranged attacks from above.

## Aftermath Seeds

- **Drowned Nightmares:** PC who fell in water and nearly drowned develops aquaphobia (disadvantage on saves vs. fear when in deep water for 1 week).
- **Patron Interest:** Climbing guild impressed by coordination—offers "Vertical Assault" training (proficiency in Athletics if don't have, or expertise if do).
- **Rumor:** Pit was old execution method—criminals dropped in, water released, forced to climb for freedom. Arena repurposed it for spectacle.
- **Downtime:** Climbing gear used in arena can be kept—functions as normal gear (50 feet rope, pitons, harness worth 25 gp total).
- **Injury:** PC who fell 50+ feet develops chronic shoulder pain (cosmetic, occasionally dislocates—no mechanical effect but roleplay opportunity).
- **Legendary Moment:** If all PCs escaped by Round 8 or earlier (2+ rounds early), crowd declares them "Masters of the Ascent"; future climbing bouts pay double.
- **Political:** Arena engineers note PCs' efficient rope use—study techniques for future gladiator training programs.
- **Loot:** Harpy wings can be harvested (DC 14 Survival)—sold for 50 gp each to alchemists (used in flying potions).
- **Cursed Water:** PC who swallowed pit water (failed drowning saves) coughs up black liquid for days (cosmetic, unsettling, no mechanical effect).
