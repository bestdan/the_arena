# AGENTS: ideas/

Use this when brainstorming new sessions or twists. Deliver concise seeds that can expand into full write-ups in `sessions/`.

## Load This Context First
- `AGENTS.md` for campaign tone.
- Optional: `sessions/Intro.md` plus current `player_characters/characters.md` to align hooks.

## Brainstorm Checklist
- Hook or theme: why this bout matters to the crowd or patrons.
- Arena layout: terrain, hazards, cover, moving parts, and how the crowd sees it.
- Main encounter: deadly for 4-6 PCs with specific foes and counts; include a flex option for smaller tables.
- Flair: announcer angles, sponsorships, or wagers that alter stakes.
- Aftermath seeds: possible patron interest, rumors, or downtime consequences.

## Output Style
- Create a new `brainstorm_*.md` entry per concept; keep bullets tight.
- Note how custom mechanics might feature (Panache, Crowd Favor, Last Stand).
- Add `[[wiki links]]` to NPCs, locations, or mechanics when they appear.
