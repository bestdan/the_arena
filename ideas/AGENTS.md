# AGENTS: ideas/

Use this when brainstorming new sessions or twists. Deliver concise seeds that can expand into full write-ups in `sessions/`.

## Load This Context First
- `AGENTS.md` for campaign tone.
- Optional: `environment/the_empire.md` `environment/the_arena.md`  plus current `players/characters.md` to align hooks.

## Levelling
- By default, give an outline of a balanced encounter for a level 5 party of 3 - 6 players. 
- If an idea does have levelling requirements due to HP, abilities etc, do feel free to include it. 

## Brainstorm Checklist
- Hook or theme: why this bout matters to the crowd or patrons.
- Arena layout: terrain, hazards, cover, moving parts, and how the crowd sees it.
- Main encounter: deadly for 3-6 PCs with specific foes and challenges. Include outlines for Level 5 party. 
- Flair: announcer angles, sponsorships, or wagers that alter stakes.
- Aftermath seeds: possible patron interest, rumors, or downtime consequences.

## Output Style
- Create a new `foo.md` entry per concept; keep bullets tight.
- Note how custom mechanics might feature ([[panache|Panache]], [[crowds_favor|Crowd Favor]], [[last_stand|Last Stand]]).
- Use Obsidian wiki-link syntax to reference NPCs, locations, or mechanics when they appear.
