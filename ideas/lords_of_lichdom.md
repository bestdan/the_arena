# Lords of Lichdom

- **Hook:** Twin necromancers—once rivals, now undead collaborators—stage a "deathless duel." The crowd's pulse quickens as life magic meets unlife. Can mortals outlast immortality?
- **Party:** 4-6 PCs, level 7-9. Necrotic damage, undead hordes, and tactical phylactery destruction.

## Arena Layout
- Crescent-moon sands with two raised bone daises (40 feet apart, 10 feet high)—each holds a necromancer.
- Central ossuary pit (20-foot diameter, 10 feet deep) filled with bones; climbing out requires Athletics DC 12 or counts as difficult terrain.
- Six rib-cage pillars provide half cover but can animate as **Bone Constructs** if necromancers spend bonus action (AC 13, 15 HP, slam +4, 1d6+2).
- Necrotic miasma seeps from pit every 3 rounds (initiative 10): all living creatures within 10 feet of pit make DC 14 Con save or take 2d6 necrotic and gain 1 level of exhaustion on failure.

## Enemies (necromancer duo plus undead reinforcements)
- 2 **Necromancer Mages** (use Mage stat block, CR 6, with *animate dead*, *blight*, *circle of death*, and *vampiric touch* prepared).
  - **Phylacteries:** Each necromancer has a hidden soul gem on their dais (AC 12, 20 HP, immune to necrotic/poison). If killed without gem destroyed, they respawn at end of next round with half HP at their dais.
- 4 **Wights** (CR 3) emerge from ossuary when combat starts.
- 8 **Skeletons** (CR 1/4) shamble up if necromancers bloodied.
- **Flex:** For 4 PCs, reduce to 1 necromancer with phylactery (other fled pre-match), 3 Wights, 6 Skeletons; necromancer has reduced HP (60 instead of standard Mage's 40 HP, but fewer high-level spells prepared). For 6 PCs, add 1 **Wraith** (CR 5) as necromancers' lieutenant and 4 more Skeletons.

## Necromancer Tactics
- **Opening:** Both necromancers cast *circle of death* overlapping zones; Wights advance to lock down melee PCs.
- **Mid-Fight:** Animate rib-cage pillars when PCs use them for cover. Cast *blight* on healers; use *counterspell* if party has casters.
- **Bloodied:** Retreat to daises, use *vampiric touch* while Skeletons screen. Command Wights to body-block phylactery access.
- **Phylactery Awareness:** If PCs destroy one gem, surviving necromancer panics—offers surrender or goes berserk with *cloudkill* centered on self.

## Crowd Favor Hooks
- First PC to identify and call out the phylacteries (Investigation DC 15 or Arcana DC 13): +2 Favor.
- Destroying a phylactery while under attack: +3 Favor to the gem-breaker.
- Turning undead and driving 4+ creatures back in one use: +2 Favor to cleric/paladin.
- Dropping a necromancer *before* their phylactery is destroyed (watching them respawn): +1 Favor ("the crowd loves the drama!").
- Using [[panache_mechanics]] to leap into ossuary pit, grab bone, and smash phylactery in one turn: +3 Favor on success.

## Hazards and Synergies
- Ossuary pit bones can be thrown (improvised weapon, 1d4 bludgeoning) or used with *animate objects* if party has caster.
- Necrotic miasma synergizes with necromancers' *vampiric touch*—they heal more while PCs rot.
- Rib-cage pillars: if animated, they grapple (contested Athletics) and hold PCs for Wight attacks.

## Announcer Beats
- Opening: "Two masters of the grave—once they fought for supremacy, now they stand united in unlife! Will flesh triumph over bone?"
- Mid-fight: "Look—the dead rise again! But which gladiator will strike the TRUE killing blow?"
- Phylactery destroyed: "A soul gem SHATTERS! That necromancer won't be getting back up—finish them!"
- Finale: "The Lords of Lichdom fall—mortality claims its own!" (victory) or "Life withers before the deathless throne!" (defeat).

## GM Tips
- Telegraph phylactery locations early with glowing gems or ominous whispers; reward Investigation or Arcana checks.
- Let necromancers taunt: "You'll have to do better than that, mortals!" after first death and respawn.
- Undead swarm can feel overwhelming—give PCs environmental advantages (knocking pillars onto skeletons, shoving Wights into pit).
- If party brings radiant damage or turn undead, lean into "crowd loves holy might versus dark magic" narrative—extra Favor for flashy plays.
- Use [[crowds_favor_mechanic]] to let PCs spend Favor mid-fight for "blessed weapon" buff (+1d6 radiant for 1 minute, 2 Favor cost).

## Aftermath Seeds
- Victory: One phylactery gem remains intact—sell it to collectors, deliver to authorities, or risk keeping it (patron offers reward or blackmail leverage).
- Defeat: Necromancers claim fallen PCs' bodies; party must negotiate for resurrection or steal corpses from necromancer tower (side quest).
- Crowd legacy: Arena nicknames emerge—"Grave-Breaker," "Bone-Crusher," "Death-Denier."
- Future rival: Surviving necromancer (if one escapes) becomes recurring villain plotting revenge.
