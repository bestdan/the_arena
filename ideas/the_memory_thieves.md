# The Memory Thieves

## Hook
Psychic parasites have infested the arena—and they've scrambled the gladiators' minds. Each PC wakes up thinking they're a DIFFERENT class. The fighter believes they're a wizard. The cleric thinks they're a rogue. They must fight through the confusion while the parasites feed on their disorientation.

## The Scramble
Before combat, secretly reassign each player's "believed class":
- Shuffle class names and deal one to each player
- Players must ROLEPLAY as that class (describe actions as if they are that class)
- Actual mechanics stay the same—the fighter still HAS fighter abilities, but describes them as "casting spells"

### Example Reassignments
- Fighter → "Wizard": Describes attacks as cantrips, Second Wind as Shield
- Cleric → "Rogue": Describes healing as "applying stolen potions," Turn Undead as "poison bomb"
- Barbarian → "Bard": Rage becomes "battle hymn," reckless attack is "inspiring recklessness"

## The Cure
**Memory Crystals** are scattered around the arena (3 total). Touching a crystal forces a DC 12 Wisdom save:
- **Success**: PC remembers who they REALLY are—ends confusion, can use abilities normally
- **Failure**: Takes 2d6 psychic damage, confusion continues

Alternative cure: Defeating a Memory Parasite returns memories to ONE PC of that player's choice.

## Arena Layout
- Standard 60 x 60 ft arena with low walls for cover
- 3 **Memory Crystals** on pedestals (north, southeast, southwest)
- **Central Pool**: Shallow reflecting pool—looking into it shows your "believed" self, not real self
- **Fog Bank**: 20 ft radius obscured area—parasites retreat here when hurt

## Enemies
- **3 Memory Parasites** (Intellect Devourer stats, CR 2, but no body-stealing—just psychic damage)
  - Feed on confusion: deal +1d4 psychic damage to confused PCs
  - Death releases memories: killing one lets a PC of killer's choice immediately recover
- **2 Echo Shades** (Shadows, CR 1/2)—look like distorted versions of the PCs, mimic their "believed" class

### Echo Shade Behavior
- Each Echo mimics a PC's believed class, not real class
- Fighter who thinks they're a wizard has an Echo that actually casts (fake) spells (1d6 force damage)
- Creates confusion about what's real

## Roleplay Mechanic
- Players must describe actions through their "believed" class lens
- Panache rolls can be made for creative class-blending descriptions
- DM can award +1 to rolls for particularly entertaining confusion roleplay

## Crowd's Favor Opportunities
- Dramatically realize "wait, I'M the fighter!" moment: +2 Favor (Panache opportunity)
- Defeat a Memory Parasite to save an ally's memories: +1 Favor
- Lean into the confusion (wizard fighter casting "sword spell"): Panache roll
- Look into reflecting pool and reject false self: +1 Favor (requires successful Wisdom save)

## Scaling
- **3 PCs**: 2 Parasites, 1 Echo Shade
- **5 PCs**: 4 Parasites, 3 Echo Shades

## Announcer Beats
- "Something's WRONG in their eyes! Do they even know WHO THEY ARE?"
- When PC acts confused: "The [class] thinks they're a [other class]! The crowd is BAFFLED!"
- Recovery moment: "CLARITY! The [name] REMEMBERS! They are [actual class], not [believed class]!"
- All PCs recover: "The fog LIFTS! They know themselves again!"

## GM Tips
- Assign believed classes to create funny combinations (the party's spellcaster thinks they're a barbarian and tries to "rage")
- Don't punish mechanically—this is roleplay flavor. Real abilities work, just described differently.
- If players struggle, have Echo Shades "demonstrate" what the believed class would do—gives hints

## Aftermath Seeds
- Memory Parasites are valuable to mindflayer patrons—political implications
- PCs who leaned into confusion gain minor reputation as "unpredictable"
- Reflecting pool water can be bottled—reveals a creature's "self-image" when splashed on them (downtime plot hook)
