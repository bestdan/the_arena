# Walk in the Park

- **Hook:** Patrons import an enchanted grove into the arena—ancient trees, perfumed flowers, and babbling streams. "A stroll through paradise!" the announcer cries. But the plants hunger, the paths betray, and nature's beauty conceals razored teeth. The crowd watches as gladiators discover that this "peaceful garden" has more corpses buried beneath its roots than the bloodiest battlefield.
- **Party:** 4-6 PCs, level 4+. Survival skills, nature knowledge, and trap awareness rewarded. Brute force alone won't save you when the flowers bloom poison and the earth swallows you whole.

## Arena Layout
- Transformed arena floor (120-foot diameter) features **dense forest terrain** with thick undergrowth (difficult terrain in most areas).
- **Winding Paths:** Three stone-paved trails (each 5 feet wide) wind through the grove, providing normal movement but lined with hidden pressure plates and tripwires.
- **Ancient Grove Center:** 30-foot-diameter clearing at the heart, featuring a **Corrupted Heart Tree** (massive oak, gnarled and oozing black sap; serves as enemy spawn point and hazard source).
- **Overgrown Sections:** Areas of thick vines and brambles (requires DC 12 Strength or Dexterity check to push through without taking 1d4 piercing damage and being slowed).
- **Deceptive Streams:** Two shallow streams crisscross the arena (5 feet wide, appear harmless but infested with leeching vines—see hazards below).
- **Elevated Platforms:** Three wooden platforms (10 feet tall, built into trees, accessible via climbing DC 10) provide vantage points and escape from ground-based threats.
- **Hidden Pit Traps:** Six concealed pitfalls (10 feet deep, covered by false foliage; Perception DC 14 to spot, Dex save DC 13 to avoid falling; 1d6 bludgeoning + impalement hazard below).
- Crowd visibility: Enchanted mist parts dramatically for "good shots"; otherwise, patrons use scrying crystals to watch gladiators navigate the deadly garden.

## Core Mechanic: Nature's Betrayal
The "peaceful park" actively works against the gladiators through environmental hazards and treacherous terrain.

### Path Traps (Triggered on stone trails)
- **Pressure Plates:** Step on marked stones (Perception DC 14, Investigation DC 12 to disarm): triggers poison dart volley (3 darts, +5 to hit, 1d4 piercing + DC 13 Con save or 2d6 poison damage).
- **Tripwires:** Thin vines stretched across path (Perception DC 13): triggers swinging log trap (DC 14 Dex save or 2d10 bludgeoning + knocked prone 10 feet backward).
- **Snare Traps:** Hidden nooses in canopy (Perception DC 15): hoists victim upside-down 15 feet in air (restrained, DC 14 Acrobatics or Strength to escape; easy target for plants/enemies).

### Environmental Hazards
- **Razorleaf Bushes:** Scattered throughout; brushing against them deals 1d4 slashing (can be identified with DC 12 Nature check and avoided).
- **Spore Clouds:** Some flowers release hallucinogenic pollen when disturbed (DC 13 Con save or disadvantage on attack rolls for 1 minute; visible as shimmering yellow dust).
- **Leeching Streams:** Crossing water without checking (DC 12 Survival to notice) triggers vine attacks from below (+4 to hit, 1d6 piercing + grappled, DC 13 Athletics/Acrobatics to break free).
- **Corrupted Roots:** Every 3 rounds (initiative count 15), roots erupt from ground in 10-foot-radius random location (DC 14 Dex save or restrained until DC 14 Strength check frees them; 1d6 bludgeoning per round restrained).

## Enemies (Nature's Guardians)
The grove spawns defenders from the Corrupted Heart Tree and lurking within the foliage.

### 4 PCs
- 3 **Vine Blights** (CR 1/2; entangling vines, regeneration in sunlight—arena has magical "sunbeams" that favor plants).
- 2 **Awakened Trees** (CR 2; slam attacks, can merge into forest terrain as action to hide).
- 1 **Shambling Mound** (CR 5; engulfing, lightning absorption, lurks in overgrown sections).
- 4 **Assassin Vines** (reskin as animated vines; grapple on hit, pull victims into hazards).

### 5 PCs
- 4 Vine Blights.
- 2 Awakened Trees.
- 1 Shambling Mound.
- 6 Assassin Vines.
- 1 **Carnivorous Flower** (reskin Otyugh; mouth-like petals, tentacle attacks, emits spore clouds).

### 6 PCs
- 5 Vine Blights.
- 3 Awakened Trees.
- 1 Shambling Mound.
- 8 Assassin Vines.
- 1 Carnivorous Flower.
- 1 **Corrupted Dryad** (use Dryad statblock with necrotic-themed spells; commands plants, can teleport between trees, CR 1 but buffed HP to 45).

### Enemy Tactics
- **Vine Blights:** Emerge from undergrowth near wounded PCs; use entangle attacks to drag victims into traps or streams.
- **Awakened Trees:** Guard key paths; use slam attacks to knock PCs into hazards; tree stride to reposition.
- **Shambling Mound:** Lurks in overgrown areas; engulfs isolated PCs; absorbs lightning attacks to heal (announce this dramatically if PCs use lightning).
- **Assassin Vines:** Grapple and pull PCs off paths into razorleaf bushes or pit traps.
- **Carnivorous Flower:** Stationary defender at Heart Tree; tentacle attacks have 10-foot reach; spore cloud affects 20-foot radius.
- **Corrupted Dryad:** Coordinates plant attacks; casts *entangle*, *barkskin* on allies; taunts PCs with nature-themed insults; teleports to avoid melee.

## Objectives
- **Primary:** Destroy the Corrupted Heart Tree (AC 15, 100 HP; immune to poison/psychic; vulnerable to fire) to "kill the grove's will" and stop plant spawning.
- **Secondary:** Survive without any PC falling into pit traps (bonus Favor for grace under pressure).
- **Tertiary:** Disable at least 3 traps before they trigger (bonus Favor for cleverness).

## Crowd Favor Hooks
- Spot and disable a trap before it triggers: +1 [[crowds_favor_mechanic|Favor]] for caution.
- Trigger a trap intentionally to damage enemies: +2 Favor for tactical improvisation.
- Use environmental hazards against enemies (push into razorleaf bushes, lure into streams): +1 Favor per creative use.
- Survive being grappled by 3+ vines/plants simultaneously and break free: +2 Favor for resilience.
- Burn down a section of the grove dramatically (sets undergrowth on fire, spreads slowly): +2 Favor for spectacle.
- Kill the Shambling Mound using fire (exploiting its vulnerability): +2 Favor for nature knowledge.
- Navigate the entire fight without stepping on a path (staying in difficult terrain to avoid traps): +1 Favor for paranoia paying off.
- Climb a platform and make a called shot from above ([[panache_mechanics|with Panache]]): +1 Favor for style.
- Destroy the Heart Tree in a single dramatic blow (30+ damage in one hit): +3 Favor for cinematic finish.

## Tactical Elements
- **Trap Awareness:** PCs with high Perception/Investigation can scout ahead and mark traps; others can use them tactically against enemies.
- **Fire Vulnerability:** Most plants fear fire; *burning hands*, *fireball*, or even torches deal extra damage (DM discretion: +1d6 fire per spell level) and can clear undergrowth.
- **Mobility vs. Caution:** Fast movement risks traps; slow progress risks being overwhelmed by spawning plants.
- **Elevated Advantage:** Platforms provide safe zones from ground hazards but make PCs visible targets for ranged plant attacks.
- **Heart Tree Priority:** Destroying it stops vine spawning and weakens remaining plants (disadvantage on attacks); but it's defended by Carnivorous Flower and roots.
- **Environmental Synergy:** Push enemies into hazards they're immune to (plants can cross streams safely, PCs cannot without checks); use this against them by forcing them onto paths with traps.

## Hazards and Twists
- **Spontaneous Bloom:** Round 4, random 20-foot-radius area blooms with **Blood Petals** (beautiful red flowers; 3d6 necrotic damage, DC 14 Con save for half; area becomes difficult terrain).
- **Vine Surge:** Initiative count 20 (rounds 2, 5, 8), Corrupted Heart Tree spawns 1d4 new Assassin Vines (max 12 total active; crowd loves/hates this depending on PC performance).
- **False Path:** One stone trail is entirely trapped; PCs who stick to it trigger 3 consecutive traps (GMs should foreshadow this with "too perfect" appearance or corpse-strewn evidence).
- **Nature's Mockery:** Corrupted Dryad (if present) mimics PC voices to lure them into traps or separate the party ("Help! I'm stuck in the stream!").
- **Overgrowth Collapse:** If PCs set major fires, sections of canopy collapse (DM chooses 20-foot-radius area; DC 13 Dex save or 3d6 bludgeoning + knocked prone).

## Announcer Beats
- Opening: "Welcome to the Verdant Graveyard! A paradise of petal and thorn! Will they smell the roses—or fertilize them?!"
- First trap triggers: "HA! The path betrays! Darts fly! Nature's first lesson: **trust nothing!**"
- Shambling Mound emerges: "From the undergrowth, a titan of rot and vine! The Mound awakens hungry!"
- PC grappled by multiple vines: "They're caught! Thorns tighten! Can they cut free before the roots claim them?!"
- Fire used dramatically: "FLAMES! The grove screams! They fight nature with mankind's oldest weapon!"
- Heart Tree damaged: "The tree bleeds black sap! Its heartbeat falters! Strike the core!"
- Victory: "The grove withers! The Heart Tree falls! Nature bows before **mortal steel and fire!** Tarsus roars!"

## GM Tips
- **Pre-mark Traps:** Use tokens or notes to track trap locations; reveal only when PCs actively search or trigger.
- **Plant Spawning:** Don't overwhelm PCs; spawn vines gradually to maintain pressure without impossible odds.
- **Nature Checks:** Reward Survival/Nature proficiency with trap hints ("This flower looks venomous") or tactical info ("Fire will spread fast here").
- **Pacing:** Early rounds = trap discovery, mid-fight = plant assault, late fight = Heart Tree showdown.
- **Dryad Roleplay:** Make her creepy-charming; she loves the "game" and taunts PCs for "destroying her garden."
- **Fire Spread:** If PCs go pyromaniac, let undergrowth burn slowly (spreads 10 feet per round); creates new difficult terrain (ash/smoke) and damages plants (1d6/round in burning areas).
- **Crowd Callouts:** Announcer occasionally warns/misleads ("Left path looks clear!" when it's the most trapped).
- **Visual Clarity:** Describe colors vividly—crimson blood petals, emerald vines, black sap—to contrast arena's "beauty" with lethality.

## Aftermath Seeds
- **Patron Interest:** Wealthy botanist fascinated by Corrupted Heart Tree remains; offers PCs contract to retrieve rare plants from dangerous locales (lucrative but perilous expeditions).
- **Rumor:** The grove was imported from the Feywild; its corruption hints at planar instability or fey court politics. Someone wanted this grove destroyed—but who?
- **Downtime:** PC who destroyed Heart Tree can harvest **Heartwood Shard** (grants resistance to poison for 24 hours when held; single use; crumbles after).
- **Injury:** PC who fell in pit trap and was impaled develops "Thornmarked" scar (visible vein-like marks on skin; no mechanical effect but NPCs react with superstition).
- **Political:** Rival arena claims the "natural spectacle" was plagiarized from their upcoming bout; accusations of espionage and copycat performances.
- **Loot:** Assassin Vines can be harvested for **Living Rope** (50 feet, can command to tie/untie self as bonus action; lasts 1d4 days before withering; 25 gp value per 50 feet).
- **Cursed Growth:** One PC who touched Corrupted Heart Tree sap must make DC 12 Wisdom save; failure = nightmares of being strangled by roots for 1d4 nights (exhaustion 1 level until cured with *lesser restoration*).
