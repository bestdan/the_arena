# Glorious End

- **Hook:** The Grand Master announces a special exhibition: "The Rite of Phoenix Flames." Gladiators face an impossible gauntlet knowing death is certain—but resurrection awaits the fallen. Victory is measured not in survival, but in how spectacularly you fall. The crowd will remember every last stand, every defiant strike, every moment of glory before the end.
- **Party:** 4-6 PCs, any level. Death is expected and **guaranteed resurrection** follows. This is a session about going out in a blaze of glory.

## Arena Layout
- The Crucible: A 100-foot circular arena ringed by towering obsidian pillars carved with resurrection runes that glow brighter with each fallen gladiator.
- Center: A raised stone platform (20-foot diameter, 10 feet high) grants high ground but makes you a target. Four weapon racks at cardinal points offer emergency armaments.
- Perimeter: Shallow channels of blessed oil can be ignited (action) to create 10-foot walls of flame (2d6 fire, difficult terrain) that burn for 3 rounds. The crowd roars when fire ignites.
- The phoenix brazier at arena center: When a PC activates [[last_stand]], the brazier flares with golden light visible to all. The crowd goes wild.

## The Impossible Odds (Deliberately Overwhelming)
This encounter is designed to kill the party. Scale enemy power to ensure no PC survives—only their glory matters.

### Wave 1: The Vanguard (Rounds 1-3)
- 4 Champion Gladiators (use Veteran, CR 3) in full plate, shields high
- 2 Arena Brutes (use Ogre, CR 2) with spiked mauls
- **Flex:** For 6 PCs, add 2 more Champions. For 4 PCs, remove 1 Brute but Champions get +10 HP each.

### Wave 2: The Beast (Round 4 or when 3+ enemies fall)
- 1 Chimera (CR 6) descends from the arena ceiling on chains, breathing fire across the sand
- 2 Beast Handlers (use Scout) who grant the Chimera advantage on attacks with Help actions
- The announcer shouts: "NOW THE BEAST! CAN THEY EVEN WOUND IT BEFORE THEY FALL?"

### Wave 3: The Executioner's Descent (Round 6 or when Chimera falls)
- 1 Pit Champion (use Gladiator CR 5 or Assassin CR 8 depending on party level) drops into the arena
- This warrior waits to execute whoever shows weakness, prioritizing wounded PCs
- Armed with poisoned blades and a net to deny [[last_stand]] escapes
- The crowd chants "FINISH THEM!" with each strike

### Reinforcements: The Endless Tide
- Every 2 rounds after Wave 2 begins, 2 additional Gladiators (use Thug) enter
- They don't stop until every PC is dead
- This ensures even successful defense eventually fails

## Objectives (Inverted)
- **Primary:** Die gloriously. Each PC should trigger [[last_stand]] and use that final turn to maximize spectacle.
- **Secondary:** Accumulate as much [[crowds_favor_mechanic]] as possible before death.
- **Hidden:** The more collective Favor the party earns, the better their resurrection and the rewards that follow.

## Crowd Favor Hooks (Enhanced for Glory)
- Activating [[last_stand]]: Automatic +3 Favor (the crowd's favorite moment)
- Declaring a dramatic final action while in Last Stand: +2 Favor if it succeeds
- Killing an enemy during Last Stand: +3 Favor (reduced from usual kill)
- Sacrificing yourself to save an ally (taking a hit meant for them): +2 Favor
- Fighting on while surrounded or isolated: +1 Favor per round
- Igniting the oil channels dramatically: +2 Favor
- Landing a hit on the Chimera or Pit Champion: +2 Favor each
- Using [[panache_mechanics]] during Last Stand: +2 Favor on success (stacks with normal Panache Favor)
- Last PC standing: +5 Favor bonus for carrying hope to the bitter end
- Party wipe achieved with combined 15+ Favor: The crowd's roaring approval echoes for weeks

## The Phoenix Resurrection
Once all PCs are dead (and they will be), the resurrection runes flare to life:
- Each PC returns to life at full HP, all spell slots restored, all equipment repaired
- Resurrection quality scales with Favor earned:
  - **0-5 Favor:** Basic resurrection, return with lingering pain (exhaustion level 1 for next session)
  - **6-10 Favor:** Clean resurrection, no penalties
  - **11-15 Favor:** Resurrection with vigor (advantage on first attack or save next session)
  - **16+ Favor:** Phoenix blessing (choose one permanent minor boon: +1 to a single skill, +5 max HP, or a trinket that grants 1 reroll per long rest)
- The Grand Master addresses them: "You have died well. The Phoenix acknowledges your courage. RISE, CHAMPIONS OF THE CRUCIBLE!"

## Announcer Beats
- Opening: "BEHOLD—THE RITE OF PHOENIX FLAMES! Today, defeat is certain, but glory is EARNED! Who among them will burn brightest before the end?"
- First [[last_stand]]: "THERE—DO YOU SEE IT? The phoenix fire! They refuse to fall! THIS is what we came to witness!"
- Chimera entrance: "The sands run red, but the beast is HUNGRY! Can dying warriors wound a monster?"
- First PC death after Last Stand: "DOWN but not FORGOTTEN! The flames remember courage! GLORY TO THE FALLEN!"
- Final PC falls: "SILENCE... (pause) ...and now, watch the MIRACLE!" (resurrection begins)
- Post-resurrection: "They have RETURNED! The Phoenix sees strength in those who defy the end! HAIL THE REBORN!"

## GM Tips
- **Embrace the TPK:** This is the point. Don't pull punches; make death inevitable and glorious
- **Track Last Stands:** Every PC should get a chance to activate [[last_stand]]—pace the damage to allow it
- **Narrate deaths dramatically:** Each final moment deserves spotlight. Ask players to describe their last action
- **Favor is currency:** Remind players constantly that Favor is the real victory condition, not survival
- **Pace the waves:** Don't rush. Let PCs have heroic moments between waves. Build dread as reinforcements arrive
- **The crowd is a character:** Describe their reactions to every brave/foolish/spectacular moment
- **After resurrection:** Give each PC a moment to stand, to hear their name chanted, to feel the weight of what they endured
- **Aftermath:** Word of this feat spreads. NPCs treat PCs differently. Patrons seek them out. They are marked by phoenix fire

## Aftermath Seeds
- A wealthy patron offers sponsorship, impressed by their defiance
- The Grand Master hints at darker "Rites" in the arena's future—trials that test more than combat
- A temple priestess approaches, curious about the resurrection magic used—she has questions about who sanctioned this
- Rival gladiators show new respect (or jealousy) toward the "Phoenix-Blessed"
- One PC's resurrection had a strange side effect (minor cosmetic change, recurring dream, or magical quirk)
- Rumors spread: "They died and came back. What else can they survive?"

## Variant: The Glorious Retreat
For groups uncomfortable with guaranteed death, offer this alternative objective:
- **Modified Goal:** Survive 10 rounds while earning 12+ combined Favor, then escape through the Phoenix Gate
- **Phoenix Gate:** Opens at round 10, requires all living PCs to reach it
- **Catch:** Each PC that triggers [[last_stand]] before escaping earns +3 party-wide Favor, tempting sacrifice for glory
- This version maintains the "expected death" drama while allowing strategic survival
