# Fennec Quickhand

**Race/Class:** Halfling Rogue (Thief), Level 3  
**Appearance:** Small, agile, constantly moving. Wears light leather, twin daggers at belt, sling at hip. Grins like she knows something you don't.  
**Personality:** Quick-witted, opportunistic, survivalist. Reads the battlefield, exploits openings, makes the crowd laugh with acrobatic dodges.

- **HP:** 21 (3d8 + 3)
- **AC:** 15 (leather armor + Dex)

- **Sneak Attack:** +2d6 damage once per turn (conditions: advantage OR ally within 5 ft of target)
- **Cunning Action:** Bonus action to Dash, Disengage, or Hide

## Background
Former pickpocket from Tarsus's lower districts. Got caught stealing from the wrong noble. Arena was supposed to be her death sentence—turned out she's good at not getting hit. One season in, learning to work angles and earn [[crowds_favor|Favor]] through cleverness, not just kills.

## Personality in Combat
- Stays mobile with Cunning Action
- Flanks for Sneak Attack opportunities
- Uses terrain and obstacles for cover
- Will Disengage to reposition rather than tank hits
- Throws insults and quips mid-combat
- Uses sling from range if melee is too hot
- Natural at environmental [[panache|Panache]] (swinging from things, backflips, etc.)

## Favor Philosophy
"They can't kill what they can't catch—and the crowd loves a good chase."

## Tactical Notes for GM
- Fragile but slippery
- High single-target damage with Sneak Attack
- Works best with allies to enable flanking
- Will use Fast Hands creatively (throwing sand, dropping caltrops, etc.)
- Survives by being annoying and untouchable
