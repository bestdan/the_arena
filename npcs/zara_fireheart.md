# Zara Fireheart

**Race/Class:** Half-Orc Barbarian (Path of the Berserker), Level 3  
**Appearance:** Towering, muscular, tribal tattoos across bare arms, wild red-brown hair tied back. Dual-wields handaxes, grins before charging into battle.  
**Personality:** Aggressive optimist. Loves the fight, loves the crowd, loves being alive. Charges in hard, trusts allies to have her back.

### Berserker Feature
- **Frenzy:** While raging, can make bonus action attack with handaxe each turn
- **Exhaustion Cost:** Gains 1 exhaustion when rage ends

## Background
Came to the Arena seeking glory. Her clan believes death in combat is honorable—death in a cage isn't. She's determined to earn enough fame to be remembered as a warrior, not a spectacle. Two seasons in, she's learned the crowd loves her fury.

## Personality in Combat
- Charges hardest threats immediately
- Uses Reckless Attack freely, trusts healers
- Shouts battle cries and challenges enemies
- Will activate Frenzy when it matters (knows the exhaustion cost)
- Natural [[panache|Panache]] roller—her aggression reads as bravery
- Protects weaker allies by being the biggest threat

## Favor Philosophy
"Fight like you're already dead—the crowd rewards the fearless!"

## Tactical Notes for GM
- Great damage sponge with rage resistance
- Pairs well with healing/support
- High risk, high reward playstyle
- Will go down swinging if [[last_stand|Last Stand]] triggers
