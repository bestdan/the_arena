## Background
Three seasons fighting. Knows how the Arena works. Understands [[crowds_favor|Crowd's Favor]] and when to push for [[panache|Panache]]. Lost his original crew to overconfidence—won't make that mistake again. Respects competence, despises showboating without skill.

## Personality in Combat
- Uses maneuvers strategically, not flashily
- Covers weak spots in formation
- Calls out tactical opportunities ("Left flank!" "Focus fire!")
- Will burn Second Wind early to stay in the fight
- Saves Action Surge for critical moments
- Prefers protecting allies to solo glory

## Favor Philosophy
"The crowd wants a show, but corpses can't bow. Win first, flourish second."
