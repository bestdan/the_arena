# Rohm

**Race/Class:** Human Fighter, Level 3  
**Appearance:** Solid build, thick legs, shoulder-length black hair, eyes like stones at the bottom of a cold river. Manacled when first introduced, but fights with quiet fury.  
**Personality:** Stoic, protective, honorable. A man of few words and absolute resolve. His threats are not empty.

## Combat Stats (Quick Reference)
- **HP:** 28 (3d10 + 6)
- **AC:** 18 (chain mail + shield)
- **Speed:** 30 ft
- **Attacks:** Spear +5 to hit, 1d6+3 piercing (melee) or 1d8+3 piercing (two-handed)
  - Thrown: +5 to hit, range 20/60, 1d6+3 piercing
- **Fighting Style:** Protection (impose disadvantage on attacks against allies within 5 ft)
- **Second Wind:** Bonus action, regain 1d10+3 HP (once per short rest)
- **Action Surge:** One extra action (once per short rest)

## Background

From the eastern steppes, part of a horse-herding people. Prisoner of war after resisting the Empire. Lost his family when they were killed. Captured after killing 12 soldiers—they only got him because his horse broke its ankle.

Brought to the Arena with three kids: **Tovo**, **Dec**, and **Lira**. Initially sentenced to die in the pens, but the party helped keep them alive in Session 3 (The Butcher's Block). The kids were moved to safety after that bout.

## Personality

- **Fiercely protective** - Threatens violence against anyone who harms those under his care
- **Man of his word** - Promised his debt to those who helped the kids; will honor it
- **Quietly competent** - Doesn't boast, just acts
- **Stoic exterior** - Rarely shows emotion, but it runs deep
- **Honorable warrior** - Believes in combat honor, not spectacle for its own sake
- **Observant** - Notices details, assesses threats, plans carefully

## In Combat

- Uses shield defensively to protect allies (Protection fighting style)
- Excellent with spear—comfortable in melee and at range
- Will throw spear for dramatic kills or to pin enemies
- Prioritizes keeping weaker allies alive over personal glory
- Saves Second Wind to stay in the fight when protecting others
- Action Surge used for critical defensive or offensive moments
- Understands [[crowds_favor|Crowd's Favor]] but doesn't chase it—earns it through protection

## Relationship with Party

**Owes a debt:** The party kept Tovo, Dec, and Lira alive in Session 3. Rohm will not forget this.

**Offers:**
- Future protection in the pens
- Connections to eastern steppe peoples (if relevant to plot)
- Tactical combat advice
- Fierce loyalty to those who prove trustworthy

**Will not tolerate:**
- Harm to innocents or those weaker
- Betrayal or broken promises
- Cowardice disguised as tactics

## In Session 4

Fights alongside the party in The Rite of Phoenix Flames. Starts with 0 Favor like everyone else. Will demonstrate proper use of [[last_stand|Last Stand]] if he dies—likely protecting another gladiator with his final moments.

Potential Last Stand moment:
> Rohm takes a mortal blow meant for an ally. As he falls to one knee, he surges back up, spear in hand. "They need me still," he growls, and makes one final throw—pinning an enemy to the arena wall before collapsing.

## Voice and Mannerisms

- Speaks in short, declarative sentences
- Deep, gravelly voice
- Makes direct eye contact when he speaks
- Rarely smiles, but respect shows in his eyes
- Physical presence commands attention even in silence

## Future Hooks

- **The Kids:** Tovo, Dec, and Lira are still in Tarsus somewhere. They may need help again.
- **Steppe Connections:** Rohm's people are still resisting the Empire. Potential plot threads.
- **Debt Repayment:** Rohm looks for ways to repay those who helped him. Opportunities for alliance.
- **Warrior's Path:** If Rohm survives enough bouts, he may seek freedom to return east.
- **Teaching:** Rohm could train PCs in defensive combat or tactical teamwork.

## GM Notes

- Use Rohm as moral compass when party faces ethical choices
- His protection-focused combat style pairs well with aggressive PCs
- His debt to the party is genuine—he's a reliable ally
- If he dies permanently (lowest Favor in Session 4), it should impact the kids' story
- If he survives Session 4, he becomes recurring ally and potential patron connection
