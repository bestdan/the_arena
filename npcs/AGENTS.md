# AGENTS: npcs/

Use this to update or add NPC profiles. Keep each entry playable at the table and tied to Arena politics.

## Load This Context First
- `AGENTS.md` for tone and themes.
- Existing NPC file if you are editing it; pull any linked sessions for continuity.

## Profile Expectations
- Include role, look/voice cues, motives, and leverage with the Arena (patrons, crews, debts).
- Include status of active / dead / other
- Track relationships to PCs and other NPCs; note promises, grudges, and favors owed.
- Record consequences from sessions (injuries, public opinions, rewards).
- Keep stat-level detail light unless it is a combatant; focus on hooks that matter in play.
- Link to appearances in `sessions/*.md` and related mechanics using Obsidian wiki-link syntax.
