Snak is the pen-boss for our player characters. A gruff, weathered Orc woman arms bearing a leather armor vest. She used to be a combatant herself, clawed her way out via victories and took the first deal to stop fighting.

She's incentivized to help keep the players and other NPCs alive because she gets a share of arena revenue and any `exposure` they have. She's a talent manager. But she also controls access to goods, services etc inside the pens.
