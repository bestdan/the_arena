# The Arena

The Arena is a massive circular coliseum in the middle of Tarsus. 

It is 200 feet in diameter with walls 20 feet tall to keep participants inside. It has 4 gates at cardinal directions for entry and exit of combatants and creatures.

It has tiered seating that can accommodate up to 10,000 spectators. The walls are made of enchanted stone that can withstand powerful magic and physical attacks, ensuring the safety of the audience.

The arena floor is a dynamic landscape that changes weekly, featuring different terrains such as dense forests, rocky mountains, swamps, and urban ruins to keep the combatants on their toes. It even has the ability to simulate weather conditions like rain, fog, and extreme heat. It can also have no floor, or be encased in magical darkness. 

It can manage total area of effect spells like casting `reduce` on everyone inside it to make the arena bigger, or `slow` to make time pass slower for those inside it.
