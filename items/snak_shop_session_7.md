## Snak's Recommendations

"Look, I'll be straight with you. This bout's about three things: **speed**, **cold damage**, and **fire resistance**."

**Essential:**
- **Potion of Fire Resistance (50 gp each):** Get at least two. Sunlight damage will kill you otherwise.

**Highly Recommended:**
- **Cold-Forged Weapon Oil (60 gp):** Extra damage against all those fire creatures.
- **Speed items (20-200 gp range):** You'll be constantly moving. Faster is better.
- **Pattern Study Briefing (30 gp):** Learn that there IS a pattern. Might save your life.

**Nice to Have:**
- **Healing Potions:** You'll take damage. Accept it.
- **Tanglefoot Bags:** Stick enemies in sunlight, watch them burn.
- **Ice Storm scrolls/wand:** Big cold damage for fire enemies.

"Don't skimp on the fire resistance. Seriously. And if you've got a caster, cold damage spells are your best friend. Good luck not burning to death."
