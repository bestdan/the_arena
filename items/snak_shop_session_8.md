# Snak's Shop - Session 8

## Snak's Recommendations

*"Burden Shared, eh? This isn't about killing fast—it's about surviving while half your team can't fight back. Let me show you what might keep the crystal intact and your carriers alive."*

"Look, I'll be straight with you. This bout's about three things: **teamwork**, **endurance**, and **Shard protection**."

**Essential:**
- **Healing Potions (50 gp each):** Get at least two per person. Carriers can't defend themselves—they WILL take damage.
- **Oil of Slipperiness (80 gp):** One carrier uses this. Makes grapples nearly impossible. Enemies WILL try to drag you apart.

**Highly Recommended:**

- **Endurance Training (30 gp):** Advantage on first Constitution save against exhaustion. Worth every copper.
- **Coordination Briefing (25 gp):** Learn proper swap techniques. Reduces risk of dropping the Shard.
- **Cold-Forged Weapon Oil (60 gp):** Those assassins use poison—cold damage helps drop them fast.

**Nice to Have:**

- **Greater Healing Potions:** Carriers take concentrated fire. Better healing saves lives.
- **Tanglefoot Bags:** Lock down enemies during swaps. Creates clean swap windows.
- **Speed items (20-200 gp range):** Defenders need mobility to cover ground and protect carriers.

"Don't cheap out on the healing. Carriers are sitting ducks for 3 rounds straight. And if you've got a grappler in your team, get them the Oil of Slipperiness. Trust me."
