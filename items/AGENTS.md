# Items

## Snak Shop
Before each session as part of setup, Snak will offer items and services. These should be thoughtfully useful to the specific encounter, but not make it too easy. 

## Equipement

Re-usable items like better armor and weapons will always be **rented**, while consumables like potions, scrolls etc will be **purchased**

## Available to rent

**Weapons**: Better than simple (non-magical) weapons like longswords, glaives etc can be rented for a moderate expense.

**Armor**: Better (non-magical) armor like plate longswords, less expensive but still helpful.

**Magical items**: These are always _expensive rentals_, not permanent ownership. 


### Avaliable to purchase

**Information**: Snak pays informants and scouts to learn about the arena, challenges and opponents. The cost should be at least 25GP, more if the information is very valuable. 

**Service**: Prep services like sharpening, tuning, specific types of practice to get advantage.

### Format
Always make it render to a sortable, filterable webpage table like from @crowds_favor.md
