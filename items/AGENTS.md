# Items

## Snak Shop
Before each session as part of setup, Snak will offer items and services. These should be useful to the encounter, but not make it too easy. 

### Avaliable to purchase

**Information**: Snak pays informants and scouts to learn about the arena, challenges and opponents. The cost should be at least 25GP, more if the information is very valuable. 

**Basic item**: Non-magical, less expensive but still helpful.

**Magical items**: These are always _expensive rentals_, not permanent ownership. 

**Service**: Prep services like sharpening, tuning, specific types of practice to get advantage.

### Format
Always make it render to a sortable, filterable webpage table like from @crowds_favor.md
