# Snak's Shop - Session 9

## Snak's Recommendations

*"Temporal Ouroboros, eh? This one's a puzzle wrapped in a paradox. You're not fighting one enemy—you're fighting FOUR versions across two timelines. Let me show you what might help you break the time loop."*

"Look, I'll be straight with you. This bout's about three things: **focus fire**, **timeline awareness**, and **surviving control magic**."

**Essential:**
- **Healing Potions (50 gp each):** Get at least two per person. That Ascendant mage hits HARD with *disintegrate* and *cone of cold*.
- **Potion of Heroism (50 gp):** Temp HP helps survive the burst damage. Immunity to frightened is a bonus.

**Highly Recommended:**

- **Wisdom Save Training (40 gp):** That *slow* spell is brutal. Advantage on Wisdom saves might save your life.
- **Tanglefoot Bags (50 gp):** Lock down the weak targets—Apprentice or Young Knight. They're your actual victory conditions.
- **Tactical Study: Temporal Combat (60 gp):** Learn the timeline shift patterns and environmental features. Knowledge is power.

**Nice to Have:**

- **Greater Healing Potions:** You're fighting a CR 9 mage. Better healing matters.
- **Cold Resistance items:** That *cone of cold* deals 8d8 damage. Cold resistance cuts it in half.
- **Speed items (20-200 gp range):** You need to reach weak targets fast before timelines shift.

"Don't waste attacks on the strong versions unless you have to. Kill the weak ones—Apprentice in the Past, Young Knight in the Future. Break BOTH links or the ouroboros resurrects them. And watch out for those Temporal Echoes—creepy as hell, seeing your own face trying to kill you."

## Snak's Final Advice

> "Remember: you're not trying to kill the strong versions. Knight Prime and Ascendant Mage are too tough—they're **obstacles**, not goals. Your targets are the Apprentice (Past timeline) and Young Knight (Future timeline). Kill BOTH of those, and the ouroboros breaks. Kill only one, and the strong version resurrects their counterpart after combat ends—you have to fight again."

> "Timeline shifts every 3 rounds. At initiative 12 the round BEFORE shift, the hourglass warns you. Use that warning—get your last hits in, prep for the switch."

> "Those Temporal Echoes spawn Round 3. They're copies of YOU from alternate timelines. Creepy, yeah. But they only have 27 HP—focus fire drops them fast. Don't let them tie up your backline."

> "Watch out for lair actions at Initiative Count 20. Temporal Fracture pushes you around, Chronal Anchor locks you down, Temporal Rewind heals enemies. After Round 8, lair actions ESCALATE—bigger damage, harder saves. Kill those weak targets before Round 8 if you can."

> "Good hunting. Break the loop."
