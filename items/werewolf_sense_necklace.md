# Werewolf Sense Necklace

## Description
A simple thick hemp necklace with a dried eye and two dried ears on it. The ears have coarse fur and are pointed, like a wolf's. The eye occasionally twiches. 

When attuned, your senses are heightenend - you can hear, smell and see better than before.

*"The wolf sees, the wolf hears, the wolf hungers."*

## Benefits
While attuned:
- **Darkvision 60 ft** (if you already have darkvision, extend range by 30 ft)
- **Advantage on Perception checks** (hearing, sight, and smell)
- You can track creatures by scent (advantage on Survival checks to track)

### Gift of the Rabid
At the **beginning of your turn in combat**, if the necklace judges you are in danger or need help, it offers its **Gift**. You feel the wolf's hunger pulse through the necklace—a hot, urgent sensation.

You may **accept or refuse** the Gift:

**If you ACCEPT:**
- Roll a Wisdom save and report it to the DM
- Gain **+10 ft movement** and **advantage on your next attack roll** this turn

DM Notes: 
- Each use of the Gift adds one **Wolf Token** to your total (use a die or token to track)

### The Price:
At the **end of your turn**
- Roll **1d20**
- If the result is **equal to or less than your Wolf Tokens**, you are **overwhelmed by the wolf's hunger**:
  - You are **stunned until the end of your next turn** as visions of the hunt consume you
  - You smell blood, hear howling, and your vision goes red
  - (In narrative, you might snarl, bare teeth, or collapse panting)
**Reset:** All Wolf Tokens reset to 0 after this roll (whether you were stunned or not)
