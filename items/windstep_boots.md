# Windstep Boots

## Description
Lightweight boots crafted from shimmering blue leather, with faint runes etched along the soles. When the wearer moves quickly, wisps of wind trail behind them like ghostly footprints. The boots feel almost weightless, as if they're eager to propel you forward.

*"Swift as the wind, but wild as the storm."*

A prize awarded from Session 6: Hunt the Hummingwym.

## Benefits

**Rarity:** Uncommon (requires attunement)

While attuned:
- Your **walking speed increases by 10 feet**
- You can use a **bonus action** to take the Dash action
- You have **advantage on Acrobatics checks** made to jump or maintain balance

### Windstep Surge (3/day)

As a bonus action, you can activate a **Windstep Surge** to gain enhanced mobility for 1 minute:
- Your walking speed increases by an additional **20 feet** (total +30 ft)
- You can **move through enemy spaces** without provoking opportunity attacks
- You ignore **difficult terrain**
- You gain a **+2 bonus to AC** from enhanced speed and unpredictability

## The Price: Uncontrolled Momentum

The boots amplify movement but make it harder to stop precisely. While attuned to the Windstep Boots:

**Momentum Risk:**
- Whenever you move **more than 40 feet** in a single turn, you must make a **DC 12 Dexterity saving throw** at the end of your movement
- **On a failure:** You overshoot your intended destination by **10 feet** in the direction you were moving (DM determines final position)
- If you collide with a solid object (wall, pillar, creature), you take **1d6 bludgeoning damage** and fall prone
- If you collide with another creature, they must make a DC 12 Strength save or also fall prone (both of you take 1d6 bludgeoning)

**During Windstep Surge:**
- The DC for the Momentum Risk increases to **DC 14**
- The overshoot distance increases to **15 feet** on a failed save
- Collision damage increases to **2d6 bludgeoning**

**Note:** This risk applies to any forced movement that brings your total movement for the turn over 40 feet, including being moved by allies or spells.

## Tactical Considerations

**Strengths:**
- Exceptional mobility for positioning
- Great for hit-and-run tactics
- Excellent for chasing fast targets (like the Hummingwym!)
- Bonus action Dash is action-economy efficient

**Weaknesses:**
- Risk of overshooting into hazards (thorn bushes, enemies, cliffs)
- Can separate you from allies if you lose control
- Environmental hazards become more dangerous
- Requires spatial awareness and planning

## Attunement Notes

**Attuning:**
- Requires 1 hour of practice with the boots
- You feel an immediate urge to run and test their speed

**Removing Attunement:**
- Standard rules (1 hour meditation without wearing the boots)
- Some wearers report feeling "slow" for a few hours after removing them
