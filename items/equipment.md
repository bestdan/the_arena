# Equipment & Gear

## The Reality

You own nothing. Between bouts, you're stripped, searched, and locked away. The Arena provides what you fight with, and it's taken back the moment you leave the sand.

Everything you carry into a match is **standard issue** or **purchased** from Snak's shop or the Black Market. Upgrades must be earned through gold, patronage, or the crowd's favor.

---

## Special Requests

**Examples:**

- Thieves' Tools (25 gp) - ✓ granted
- Disguise Kit (25 gp) - ✓ granted
- Healer's Kit (5 gp) - ✓ granted

- Caltrops (1 gp, 20 uses) - ✗ denied, buy from Black Market / Snak Shop
- Ball Bearings (1 gp, 1000) - ✗ denied, buy from Black Market / Snak Shop

## Upgrades & Premium Gear

### How to Get Better Equipment

1. **Purchase from [[blackmarket|Black Market]]** - consumables, specialty ammo, protective gear
2. **Purchase from [[Snak|Snak's Shop]]** - session-specific, weird, situational, sometimes magical items
3. **Earn from Patrons** - wealthy benefactors may gift equipment after impressive performances
4. **Crowd's Favor** - some Favor abilities grant temporary gear or weapons mid-fight
5. **Loot the Fallen** - you might claim an opponent's weapon for that bout only

### What Premium Gear Looks Like
- **Plate Armor** (1,500 gp, AC 18) - patron gift or major reward
- **+1 Weapons** - rare Arena prizes or patron gifts
- **Exotic Weapons** - earned through specific challenges
- **Magic Items** - almost never issued; must be won or gifted

---

## Between-Bout Storage

**You can't keep gear on your person between matches.**

However:
- **Consumables purchased** from Black Market/Snak are stored in your cell and available next bout
- **Gold** is tracked by Arena bookkeepers (they take a cut, naturally)
- **Favor with NPCs** (patrons, Snak, other gladiators) persists
- **Reputation** grows with the crowd

Eventually, successful gladiators may earn the privilege of personal armories. That's a long way off.

## Combat Clarifications

### Broken Equipment
- **Simple weapons** that break are replaced next bout at no cost
- **Martial weapons** (purchased) that break are **gone unless repaired**
- Purchased/gifted items that break are **gone unless repaired**
- Black Market offers "Risky Weapon Sharpening" and similar services

### Looting Mid-Fight
If an enemy drops a better weapon and you have a free hand:
- **Free object interaction** to pick it up
- **Action** if it's more complex (stripping armor, etc.)
- DM discration about keeping it for the next bout as a special weapon

---

## Philosophy

The Arena wants **good fights**, not fair ones. All gladiators can access Simple weapons freely to ensure basic combat capability, but Martial weapons carry premium fees—forcing tactical choices:

- **Resource Management** - Save gold for Martial weapon upgrades, healing potions, or better armor?
- **Build Diversity** - Simple weapon users save gold; Martial weapon specialists pay for power
- **Risk/reward** - Using expensive consumables or premium weapons creates tension
- **Drama** - Looting an enemy's flaming sword mid-fight is pure spectacle
- **Progression** - Premium Martial weapons and magic items feel earned, not given

You're not adventurers with backpacks full of rope and rations. You're gladiators. Every advantage is temporary, every victory costs something, and every piece of gear is a privilege, not a right.

**Fight well, earn more. Die poorly, lose everything.**
