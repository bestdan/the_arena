# Session 7 GM Setup: Blazing Shadows

## Pre-Session Checklist

**Party Composition:**
- 5 PCs, level 4
- Expected classes/builds: Mix of melee and ranged, at least one spellcaster recommended
- Check for fire resistance abilities, cold damage sources, mobility features

**Mechanics to Review:**
- [[../../mechanics/crowds_favor|Crowd Favor]] system
- [[../../mechanics/panache|Panache]] for flashy actions
- Environmental damage (sunlight as hazard)
- Grapple rules (Fire Elementals)
- Concentration checks (if using *heat metal*)
- Exhaustion conditions and effects

**Key Resources:**
- Shadow tracking tokens (3 different sizes for Father/Mother/Child)
- Compass direction markers (N/NE/E/SE/S/SW/W/NW plus CENTER on battle map)
- **Movement Schedule reference** (keep the pre-programmed pattern table handy)
- Focal point cycle tracker (mark rounds 4, 8, 12, etc.)
- Amplifying Stone tokens (3 total, DC 12 Perception)
- Round-specific riddle reference cards
- Round counter (visible to players for tension)
- Initiative tracker with shadow movement at count 20

**Session Goal:**
- High-tension environmental combat emphasizing positioning and prediction
- Reward strategic thinking (solving riddles, tracking shadows, planning movement)
- Create memorable moments (focal point convergences, dramatic riddle solutions, clutch shadow dives)
- Showcase environmental lethality while keeping deaths heroic, not cheap
- Establish riddles as viable alternative to pure Arcana checks

## Roleplaying Hooks

### Snak's Pre-Session Briefing
Snak should emphasize three things:
1. **Shadows are life**—staying in sunlight will kill you
2. **Riddles are tools**—solving them gives tactical edge
3. **Focal point is key**—every 4 rounds, plan to be at center

Tone: Professional warning. This is legitimately dangerous, and she respects their skill enough to give them straight information (if paid).

### Mystical Voice for Riddles
The riddles should be delivered in an otherworldly, echoing voice—not the announcer, but something ancient and magical tied to the moon-stones themselves.

**Voice characteristics:**
- Ethereal, gender-neutral
- Echoes slightly
- Speaks in rhythmic cadence
- Pauses for dramatic effect

**Example delivery:**
> [Ethereal voice echoes across arena]
> 
> "I follow behind you by day..." [pause]
> 
> "But vanish when clouds come to play..." [pause]
> 
> "What... am... I?"

### Enemy Characterization

**Fire Elementals (3):**
- Mindless but purposeful
- Seek to control shadows by blocking access
- Grapple instinctively toward sunlight
- Communicate through roaring flames

**Salamanders (2):**
- Intelligent, tactical
- One should use *heat metal* early to establish threat
- The other ambushes from shadows
- Speak Ignan (can taunt in Common if needed)

**Efreeti Enforcer (1):**
- Arrogant, commands lesser elementals
- Stays airborne, mocks ground-bound combatants
- Uses *wall of fire* strategically to herd PCs
- Surrenders if reduced below 40 HP (recognizes skilled opponents)

**Magma Mephits (4):**
- Chaotic, giggly
- Excited to explode
- Swarm tactics, target clustered PCs
- Simple motivations: find shadows, die dramatically

## Combat Flow Suggestions

### Pre-Combat (Round 0)
- PCs enter arena, see Scorching Sun overhead
- Three moon-stones visible at North, East, South positions
- Enemies enter from opposite gate
- Announcer delivers opening speech
- **First mystical riddle posed BEFORE initiative**
- Roll initiative, mark shadow movement at count 20

**GM Focus:**
- Set the scene: oppressive heat, blinding light, moving shadows
- Give PCs moment to spot Amplifying Stones (passive Perception 12 or active checks)
- Establish focal point cycle counter (currently Round 1, next convergence Round 4)
- Ask about fire resistance (potions, abilities)

### Opening Rounds (1-3)
- Shadows at starting positions (N/E/S/W)
- PCs establish positioning in shadows
- Enemies advance, spread out
- Fire Elementals attempt grapples
- Salamander uses *heat metal* on armored PC
- Efreeti stays back, observes, taunts
- Mephits advance toward PC clusters

**Shadow Movement Pattern (Rounds 1-3):**
- Round 1: Father(N)→NE, Mother(E)→SE, Child(S)→W
- Round 2: Father(NE)→S, Mother(SE)→N, Child(W)→NE  
- Round 3: Father(S)→W, Mother(N)→NW, Child(NE)→E

**GM Focus:**
- Narrate heat viscerally on first sunlight damage
- Track who's in sun vs shadow clearly
- Pose 1-2 riddles (mix silent and shouted)
- If Amplifying Stone found, describe it glowing faintly
- Establish enemy threat: grapple attempts, *heat metal* forcing choices

### Mid-Combat (Rounds 4-7)
- **Round 4: FOCAL POINT CONVERGENCE**
- All shadows meet at arena center (50-foot zone)
- Both PCs and enemies converge
- Intense melee combat in the focal point
- Efreeti uses *wall of fire* to block retreat
- After Round 4, shadows resume rotation

**Shadow Movement Pattern (Rounds 4-7):**
- Round 4: ALL at CENTER (convergence)
- Round 5: Father→E, Mother→SW, Child→N (dispersing)
- Round 6: Father→NW, Mother→S, Child→SE
- Round 7: Father→SE, Mother→NE, Child→SW

**GM Focus:**
- Build tension before Round 4: "One more round until CONVERGENCE!"
- Make focal point feel crowded (opportunity attacks, positioning battles)
- Enemies fight desperately to stay in focal point zone
- Mephits explode in clustered combat (death bursts)
- Continue posing riddles (2-3 more)
- Track exhaustion for any PC who's been in sun 5+ rounds

### Late Combat (Rounds 8+)
- **Round 8: SECOND FOCAL POINT CONVERGENCE**
- Fewer enemies remaining (hopefully)
- PCs may control focal point
- Efreeti considers surrender if losing badly
- Remaining enemies fight defensively

**GM Focus:**
- Focal point feels like "home base" now—safe zone battle
- Reward strategic play (PCs who planned ahead shine here)
- Describe enemy desperation or tactical retreat
- Allow Efreeti surrender if 4+ other enemies dead and he's bloodied
- Final riddles for dramatic flair

## Shadow Tracking System

### Physical Setup
Use 3 different sized tokens:
- **Father:** Large token (40ft shadow template or marker)
- **Mother:** Medium token (30ft shadow template)
- **Child:** Medium-small token (25ft shadow template)

Mark compass directions clearly on battle map: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, plus CENTER

**Keep Movement Schedule handy** - reference the pre-programmed pattern from the encounter document

### Movement Tracking
At initiative count 20 each round:
1. Announce: "The moon-stones SHIFT!"
2. Consult Movement Schedule for current round
3. Move each token to new position as specified in pattern
4. Update shadow positions on map
5. Ask if anyone's caught in sunlight now
6. Resolve sunlight damage for those starting turns in sun
7. **Emphasize the unpredictable pattern** - it's not simple clockwise

### Focal Point Cycle
Track openly:
- Round 1: "3 rounds until convergence"
- Round 2: "2 rounds until convergence"
- Round 3: "1 round until convergence"
- Round 4: "CONVERGENCE!" (all shadows at center)
- Round 5: "3 rounds until next convergence"
- Continue pattern...

---

## Riddle Implementation

### Riddle Delivery
- Pose 1 riddle every 1-2 rounds (roughly 5-7 total during combat)
- Alternate between silent and shouted riddles
- If no one attempts to solve after 2 rounds, repeat or offer hint

### Riddle Solving
**Process:**
1. Mystical voice poses riddle (free action, happens during round)
2. Any PC can attempt to solve as bonus action
3. PC states their answer out loud (at table)
4. GM judges if answer is correct or reasonably close
5. If correct: Reveal shadow movement information **from Movement Schedule**
6. If shouted riddle: Enemies also benefit from information
7. **Use round-specific riddles when appropriate** (see encounter document)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Exact answers always work
- Creative interpretations that show understanding also work
- Wildly wrong answers fail but don't penalize

**Information Revealed:**
- Silent riddles: Whisper to player or pass note
- Shouted riddles: State loudly for all (including enemies)

### Sample Riddle Sequence
Use round-specific riddles from encounter document when possible:
1. **Round 1 (Silent):** "From north to sun's first light..." → Reveals Round 1 movements (Father→NE, Mother→SE, Child→W)
2. **Round 2 (Shouted):** "The giant falls to sunset's gate!..." → PC shouts movements for Round 2
3. **Round 3 (Silent):** "When the eldest seeks the west wind's call..." → Reveals Round 3 movements
4. **Round 4 (Shouted):** "THREE PATHS CONVERGE..." → PC shouts "CENTER!" revealing focal point
5. **Round 5+ (Generic):** Use generic riddles as needed, revealing information from Movement Schedule

## Important Mechanics Reminders

### Sunlight Damage Resolution
**Start of each PC's turn:**
1. Check position: Full sun, partial shadow, or full shadow?
2. If full sun: 2d6 fire damage (no save, automatic)
3. If partial shadow: 1d6 fire damage
4. If full shadow: No damage
5. Track cumulative rounds in sun (5 rounds = 1 exhaustion level)

### Heat Exhaustion Tracking
Keep public tally:
- "Kael has been in sun 2 rounds"
- "Imara: 4 rounds—one more and you gain exhaustion!"
- "Torgana gains 1 level of exhaustion—disadvantage on ability checks"

**Exhaustion Effects:**
- Level 1: Disadvantage on ability checks
- Level 2: Speed halved

**Max 2 levels from sunlight** (but other sources can add more)

### *Heat Metal* Interaction
**When Salamander casts *heat metal*:**
- Target must be wearing metal armor or holding metal weapon
- No initial save—automatically takes 2d8 fire
- Each subsequent round (Salamander's turn):
  - Target takes 2d8 fire (no save)
  - Target has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks
  - Target can drop item (free action) to end effect on self
- **Interaction with sunlight:** PC must choose—stay in shadow with *heat metal*, or move to different shadow and risk sunlight
- Concentration: If Salamander loses concentration, effect ends

### Grapple and Drag
**Fire Elemental grapple:**
1. Elemental attacks: +5 to hit, 2d6 fire + grapple attempt
2. If hit connects: Target makes contested Athletics/Acrobatics vs Elemental's Athletics (+5)
3. If target fails: Grappled (speed 0, disadvantage on attacks)
4. Elemental's next turn: Can move half speed (26 feet) dragging target
5. **Tactical use:** Drag PC from shadow into sunlight

**Breaking grapple:**
- PC's action: Contested check vs Elemental's Athletics (+5)
- Ally's action: Shove Elemental (opposed check) can separate them
- Killing Elemental automatically frees target

## Key Takeaways for GM

1. **Environment is the star**—sunlight should feel constantly threatening
2. **Shadow movement is predictable**—reward PCs who plan ahead
3. **Riddles are optional tools**—don't force them, let PCs discover value
4. **Focal point creates drama**—rounds 4 and 8 should be epic convergences
5. **Amplifying Stones are risk/reward**—don't punish PCs for using them, but make enemies react
6. **Track everything openly**—round count, shadow positions, focal point countdown
7. **Narrate heat viscerally**—"Your skin blisters," "Hair singes," "Metal armor burns"
8. **Enemies use tactics**—Fire Elementals grapple, Salamanders cast *heat metal*, Efreeti herds
9. **Allow Efreeti surrender**—honorable defeat is more interesting than forced TPK
10. **Celebrate victories**—PCs who master this encounter deserve recognition

Good luck, GM! Make them dance with fire and shadow!
