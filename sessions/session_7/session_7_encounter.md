# Session 7 Encounter: Blazing Shadows

## The Dance of Fire and Shadow

**Party:** 5 PCs, level 4
**Objective:** Defeat all fire-born enemies while surviving the Scorching Sun's deadly radiation. Use the moving shadows cast by three orbiting moon-stones to avoid constant fire damage.
**Expected Outcome:** High-tension positional combat where prediction and planning matter more than raw damage. Multiple PC knockdowns expected, but deaths should feel heroic, not cheap.

---

## Arena Layout

Circular arena (120-foot diameter) with packed dirt floor. The defining feature is the magical Scorching Sun suspended 80 feet overhead, radiating killing heat.

### Key Features

**The Scorching Sun** (80 feet overhead)
- Magical orb containing bound fire elemental
- Radiates intense heat and light across entire arena

- **Mother (East start):** Large sphere (20-foot diameter), casts 30-foot diameter shadow
- **Child (South start):** Medium sphere (18-foot diameter), casts 25-foot diameter shadow
- Follow pre-programmed movement pattern at Initiative count 20 (see Movement Schedule below)
- Movements appear random but follow specific pattern each round
- Cannot be climbed, attacked, or interacted with

**Arena Center** (Focal Point)
- Where all shadows converge every 4 rounds
- 50-foot diameter safe zone during convergence
- Becomes primary battlefield during convergence rounds
- Otherwise just open dirt

**Amplifying Stones** (3 scattered)
- **Location 1:** Northeast quadrant (near Father's starting shadow edge)
- **Location 2:** Southwest quadrant (open area, no cover)
- **Location 3:** Arena center (near focal point)

- No walls, pillars, or obstacles
- Emphasizes movement and positioning over terrain tactics

### Environmental Rules

**Sunlight Damage:**
- Any creature starting its turn in direct sunlight: 2d6 fire damage (no save, automatic)
- Partial shadow coverage (creature half-in, half-out): 1d6 fire damage
- Full shadow coverage: No damage, complete safety

**Heat Exhaustion:**
- After 5 cumulative rounds in direct sunlight (not consecutive), creature gains 1 level of exhaustion
- Maximum 2 levels of exhaustion from this effect
- Track publicly: "Kael: 3 rounds in sun"

**Shadow Movement:**
- At Initiative count 20 (losing ties to other effects on 20)
- All three moon-stones move to new positions following pre-programmed pattern
- Movements appear random but follow specific schedule (see Movement Schedule below)
- Use compass directions: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, CENTER
- Shadows overlap occasionally (safe zones become larger)

**Movement Schedule (Pre-Programmed Pattern):**

| Round | Start Positions | End Positions | Notes |
|-------|----------------|---------------|-------|
| 1 | Father=N, Mother=E, Child=S | Father→NE, Mother→SE, Child→W | Initial spread |
| 2 | Father=NE, Mother=SE, Child=W | Father→S, Mother→N, Child→NE | Cross-pattern |
| 3 | Father=S, Mother=N, Child=NE | Father→W, Mother→NW, Child→E | Converging |
| 4 | Father=W, Mother=NW, Child=E | **All→CENTER** | **FOCAL POINT** |
| 5 | All at CENTER | Father→E, Mother→SW, Child→N | Dispersing |
| 6 | Father=E, Mother=SW, Child=N | Father→NW, Mother→S, Child→SE | Spread pattern |
| 7 | Father=NW, Mother=S, Child=SE | Father→SE, Mother→NE, Child→SW | Triangle rotation |
| 8 | Father=SE, Mother=NE, Child=SW | **All→CENTER** | **FOCAL POINT** |
| 9 | All at CENTER | Father→N, Mother→W, Child→E | Dispersing |
| 10 | Father=N, Mother=W, Child=E | Father→SW, Mother→NE, Child→NW | Complex weave |
| 11 | Father=SW, Mother=NE, Child=NW | Father→E, Mother→SE, Child→N | Converging |
| 12 | Father=E, Mother=SE, Child=N | **All→CENTER** | **FOCAL POINT** |
| 13+ | Pattern repeats from Round 5 onward | | Continues cycling |

**Focal Point Convergence:**
- Rounds 4, 8, 12, 16, etc. (every 4 rounds)
- All three shadows converge at arena center
- Creates 50-foot diameter zone of complete safety
- Both PCs and enemies will fight for this position
- Track countdown openly to build tension

**Visibility:**
- Bright light everywhere (Scorching Sun)
- No darkness, dim light, or shadow-based concealment
- Shadows provide safety, not stealth

## Special Mechanic: Shadow Riddles

Instead of (or in addition to) Intelligence (Arcana) checks to predict shadow movement, mystical voices pose riddles throughout combat. Solving them grants perfect knowledge of shadow positions for the next round.

**Riddle Mechanic:**
- Mystical voice poses riddle (free action during round, doesn't interrupt initiative)
- Any PC can attempt to solve as bonus action on their turn
- State answer aloud at table
- GM judges correctness (exact answers or creative interpretations that show understanding)
- Correct answer reveals specific shadow movement information
- Each riddle can only be used once per encounter
- Wrong answers grant no information but don't penalize

**Round-Specific Riddles:**

Each riddle below corresponds to a specific round's movement. GM should pose these in order, or mix with generic riddles.

**Round 1 Riddle (Silent):**
"From north to sun's first light, from east to sun's last sight, from south to moon's dark night. Where do they take flight?"
- *Answer:* Northeast, Southeast, West (or describing the three movements)
- *Reveals:* Father→NE, Mother→SE, Child→W

**Round 2 Riddle (Shouted):**
"The giant falls to sunset's gate! The matron rises to dawn's fate! The young one climbs where sun and moon both wait! SHOUT their paths before too late!"
- *Answer to shout:* "FATHER SOUTH! MOTHER NORTH! CHILD NORTHEAST!" (or describing movements)
- *Reveals to all:* Father→S, Mother→N, Child→NE

**Round 3 Riddle (Silent):**
"When the eldest seeks the west wind's call, and mother chases sunset's fall, the child runs east where shadows sprawl. Name where each shall be, and tell it all."
- *Answer:* West, Northwest, East
- *Reveals:* Father→W, Mother→NW, Child→E

**Round 4 Riddle (Shouted):**
"THREE PATHS CONVERGE WHERE DARKNESS GROWS! The family reunites where safety flows! Shout the word that every warrior knows!"
- *Answer to shout:* "CENTER!" or "FOCAL POINT!" or "NOW!"
- *Reveals to all:* All shadows converge at arena center (Focal Point)

**Round 5 Riddle (Silent):**
"After unity comes the scatter. Father seeks dawn, Mother dusk, Child midnight. Three shadows shatter."
- *Answer:* East, Southwest, North
- *Reveals:* Father→E, Mother→SW, Child→N

**Round 6 Riddle (Shouted):**
"The giant strides to shadow's corner where night meets north! Mother holds the southern edge! The child guards where sun and earth are fourth! SHOUT WHERE THEY PLEDGE!"
- *Answer to shout:* "NORTHWEST! SOUTH! SOUTHEAST!" (or describing positions)
- *Reveals to all:* Father→NW, Mother→S, Child→SE

**Round 7 Riddle (Silent):**
"A triangle of three: The strongest seeks where sun descends and south meets east. The gentlest finds where dawn begins and north seeks feast. The youngest flies where west meets south, at least."
- *Answer:* Southeast, Northeast, Southwest
- *Reveals:* Father→SE, Mother→NE, Child→SW

**Round 8 Riddle (Shouted):**
"AGAIN THE DANCE COMPLETES ITS TURN! Three become one where shadows yearn! Shout the count until they meet and converge and burn!"
- *Answer to shout:* "CENTER!" or "NOW!" or "FOCAL POINT!"
- *Reveals to all:* All shadows converge at center again (Focal Point)

**Round 9 Riddle (Silent):**
"From the heart, three paths diverge: north pole, west wind, eastern surge."
- *Answer:* North, West, East
- *Reveals:* Father→N, Mother→W, Child→E

**Round 10 Riddle (Shouted):**
"FATHER FALLS TO SUNSET'S EMBRACE! MOTHER CLIMBS TO SUNRISE'S GRACE! THE CHILD FINDS SHADOW'S NORTHERN SPACE! SHOUT THEIR RACE!"
- *Answer to shout:* "SOUTHWEST! NORTHEAST! NORTHWEST!" (or similar)
- *Reveals to all:* Father→SW, Mother→NE, Child→NW

**Generic Silent Riddles (use any round):**

1. "I follow behind you by day, but vanish when clouds come to play. What am I?"
   - *Answer:* A shadow
   - *Reveals:* Current positions of all three shadows (GM chooses one to reveal next position)

2. "Three dancers waltz in patterned time. Which casts the widest net sublime?"
   - *Answer:* Father (or the largest/Huge)
   - *Reveals:* Father's shadow (40-foot diameter) current and next position

   - *Answer:* Number of rounds until next focal point (count from current round)
   - *Reveals:* Exactly when all three shadows will converge at the focal point

**Generic Shouted Riddles (use any round):**

   - *Answer to shout:* "[DIRECTION]!" (current round's Mother movement)
   - *Reveals to all:* Mother's next position

3. "THE CHILD RUNS SWIFT ON DANCING FEET! Shout where the smallest shadow meets!"
   - *Answer to shout:* "[DIRECTION]!" (current round's Child movement)
   - *Reveals to all:* Child's next position

**Alternative: Arcana Check:**
- Action to study shadow movement
- Intelligence (Arcana) DC 12
- Success: Learn one specific shadow's next position
- No risk of revealing to enemies
- Less dramatic than riddles

**GM Tips:**
- Pose 1 riddle every 1-2 rounds (5-7 total during full combat)
- Alternate silent and shouted
- Deliver in ethereal, echoing voice (not announcer)
- Accept creative answers
- Make enemies react to shouted answers dramatically

## GM Tips

### Shadow Tracking Setup
- Use 3 different sized tokens/templates on battle map
- Mark compass directions clearly (N/NE/E/SE/S/SW/W/NW plus CENTER)
- **Keep Movement Schedule visible** to GM (reference table from above)
- Track focal point countdown openly (write on board: "Convergence in 2 rounds")
- Move shadows simultaneously at Initiative 20 (announce: "The moon-stones SHIFT!")
- Emphasize the unpredictable pattern—it's not simple clockwise### Narrating Environmental Damage
Make sunlight damage feel threatening:
- "Your exposed skin blisters instantly"
- "The metal of your armor becomes almost too hot to touch"
- "Your hair singes, the smell of burning filling your nostrils"
- "Heat mirages shimmer around you—the air itself wants to cook you"
- "You feel your strength sapping away—this heat will kill you if the enemies don't"

### Riddle Delivery
- Use different voice (ethereal, echoing) from announcer
- Speak slowly, with dramatic pauses
- Example: "I follow... behind you... by day... [pause] But vanish... when clouds... come to play... [pause] What... am... I?"
- Accept creative answers that show understanding

### Enemy Intelligence
- Fire Elementals: Low intelligence, but tactical—block shadows, grapple toward sunlight
- Salamanders: Smart—coordinate *heat metal*, use constriction, ambush
- Efreeti: Brilliant—uses *wall of fire* strategically, stays out of melee, surrenders if smart
- Mephits: Chaotic but focused—swarm, explode dramatically

### Pacing
- Keep rounds moving (use timer between rounds)
- Skip trivial movement ("You dash to Child's shadow—you make it, next?")
- Pose riddles during enemy turns (keeps PCs engaged)
- Use announcer beats every 2-3 rounds (break up combat)
- Build tension before focal points (count down last 3 rounds)
- **Emphasize the mystery** of shadow movement—PCs don't know the pattern without solving riddles

### Handling PC Deaths
- Sunlight + damage can cause quick knockdowns
- Allies can drag unconscious PCs to shadows (half speed, no attack of opportunity)
- Efreeti won't target unconscious PCs (honorable)
- Fire Elementals WILL grapple unconscious PCs (mindless)
- Death saves still apply—PCs can be stabilized

### Efreeti Surrender
If conditions met (HP below 40, 4+ allies dead):
- Efreeti lands gracefully
- "Enough. You have proven yourselves. I yield—not from fear, but respect."
- Drops scimitars, bows slightly
- Will answer 1-2 questions if PCs ask
- Arena guards escort him away
- Crowd cheers (respects honorable combat)

## Aftermath Seeds

### Immediate Rewards
- Gold and Crowd Favor as noted
- Shadow Dancer's Token (to PC with best positioning)
- One Amplifying Stone keepsake (to PC who used it best)

### Plot Hooks
- **Fire Cult Interest:** Representatives approach PCs after bout—"You survived the sun's judgment. Join us, learn true fire mastery."
- **Djinn Liberation:** Activist whispers to PCs—"The Scorching Sun is a bound djinn's heart. Help us free it, we'll make it worth your while."
- **Salamander Scales:** Can be harvested (alchemist can craft fire resistance salve, 75 gp cost, 1 hour duration)
- **Efreeti's Respect:** If surrendered, he later sends gift (brass chains worth 200 gp or uncommon magic item)

### Injuries/Complications
- **Sun-Scarred:** PC with severe sunburns gains trait—disadvantage on Charisma checks due to disfigurement, but advantage on Intimidation vs fire creatures
- **Heat Exhaustion Lingering:** PC who gained exhaustion must rest to recover (long rest removes 1 level)
- **Armor Warped:** PC targeted by *heat metal* must pay 50 gp to repair armor (or disadvantage on Stealth until fixed)

### Reputation
- Known as "Shadow Dancers" or "Sun Survivors"
- Fire-aligned factions respect or fear them
- Bookies adjust odds (harder to bet on them now)
- Other gladiators study their tactics

## Scaling Options

### If Combat Too Easy
- Increase Efreeti HP to 180
- Add 1 Fire Elemental reinforcement (Round 5)
- Sunlight damage becomes 2d6+2
- Salamanders coordinate *heat metal* on 2 PCs simultaneously
- Reduce shadow overlap (smaller safe zones)

### If Combat Too Hard
- Reduce Efreeti HP to 120
- Remove 1 Fire Elemental (only 2 total)
- Sunlight damage becomes 2d4
- Give PCs 1 free Potion of Fire Resistance each
- Increase shadow overlap (larger safe zones)

### If Too Chaotic
- Remove Magma Mephits entirely
- Simplify riddles (give more hints)
- Make shadows move every 2 rounds instead of every round

### If Not Chaotic Enough
- Add 2 more Magma Mephits (6 total)
- Salamanders both cast *heat metal*
- Efreeti uses *wall of fire* Round 2 (earlier)
- Shadows move unpredictably (roll 1d8 for direction each round)

## Final Notes

This encounter rewards:
- **Planning:** PCs who predict shadow movement dominate
- **Coordination:** Calling out shadow positions helps everyone
- **Mobility:** High-speed, Dash-using PCs excel
- **Cold damage:** Any cold spells/abilities are MVP
- **Fire resistance:** Potions or abilities trivialize sunlight damage

This encounter punishes:
- **Standing still:** Shadows move, you must move
- **Ignoring environment:** Sunlight WILL kill you
- **Splitting party:** Isolated PCs get grappled into sun
- **Heavy armor:** *Heat metal* + sunlight = death
- **No planning:** Random movement = constant sunlight damage

Make them EARN this victory. It should feel like a dance—elegant, dangerous, exhilarating.

Good luck, GM! Make the sun burn!
