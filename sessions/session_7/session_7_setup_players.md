# Session 7 Setup: Blazing Shadows

### 3 Days After Session 6

The arena buzzes with talk of the Pygmy Wyvern hunt. Your team walked away victorious—bloodied, but victorious. The little creature has bonded with you, chirping happily in its cage back at the pen.

[[../../npcs/snak|Snak]] shows up three days later, looking unusually serious.

> "Alright, listen up. You've done well so far—survived the night hunt, caught the Wyvern, built a reputation. The Grand Master's noticed. That's good and bad."

She pulls out a worn parchment with charred edges.

> "Session Seven. They're calling it 'Blazing Shadows.' Ever hear of the Scorching Sun arena configuration? No? Consider yourself lucky—until now."

She unfurls the parchment, showing a rough sketch.

> "Here's the deal: They're hanging a magical sun overhead. Not metaphorical—an actual captured fire elemental bound into an orb. It burns. Standing in direct sunlight deals fire damage every turn. Your only safety? The shadows cast by four floating moon-stones that orbit the arena."

She taps the sketch.

> "The shadows move. Every few seconds, the moon-stones rotate clockwise around the center. You'll need to chase the shadows while fighting fire-adapted enemies who LOVE the sun. It's a dance—miss a step and you burn."

She looks each of you in the eye.

> "They've also added something... theatrical. Riddles. Mystical voices will pose riddles during the fight. Solve them, and you'll know where the shadows move next. There are also Amplifying Stones scattered around—shout your answer using one, and everyone hears it. Allies AND enemies."

> "This one's level 4 recommended, but don't let that fool you. The environment's the real killer. Want intel? 25 gold for basics, 50 for the deep dive. Your call."

### The Night Before the Match

Snak returns with detailed notes if you paid for intel.

> "Right. Blazing Shadows breakdown."

**If PCs paid for Snak's intel (50 gp), she provides additional details:**

> "The arena's 120 feet across, circular, dirt floor. The Scorching Sun hangs 80 feet up—can't reach it, can't destroy it. Four moon-stones orbit at 40 feet high, casting shadows on the ground."

She points to her notes.

> "The moon-stones aren't identical. Father's the biggest—huge sphere, casts a 40-foot shadow. Mother's large—30-foot shadow. Brother and Sister are small—20-foot shadows each. They start at North, East, South, and West, rotating clockwise every round. Use compass directions to track them."

> "Sunlight damage: 2d6 fire every turn you start in it. No save. Partial cover from shadow? Half damage. Stay in sun too long—five rounds total—and you gain exhaustion. Two levels max from this effect, but that's enough to kill you when you're already fighting."

> "The shadows overlap sometimes. Every four rounds, they ALL converge at the arena center—50-foot safe zone. That's your focal point. Both you and the enemies will fight for that spot."

> "The riddles? Ten of them. Five are silent—solve them, you learn shadow positions privately. Five are shouted—you need an Amplifying Stone to yell the answer, and everyone hears it. Three stones scattered around the arena, DC 12 Perception to spot them. They glow faintly when a shouted riddle is posed."

She flips to enemy notes.

> "Enemies: Three Fire Elementals—CR 5 each, immune to fire, they'll grapple you and drag you into sunlight. Two Salamanders—CR 5, they use *heat metal* on armored targets, forcing you to choose between armor or burning. One Efreeti Enforcer—CR 11 but nerfed to about 150 HP—stays airborne, commands the elementals, uses *wall of fire* to cut off escape routes. Four Magma Mephits—weak individually, but their death burst creates fire hazards."

> "Enemy tactics: Fire Elementals block shadows, grapple and drag. Salamanders ambush from shadows, use *heat metal*. Efreeti herds you with fire walls, stays out of reach. Mephits suicide rush into your groups."

> "The riddles are your edge. Solve them correctly—especially the silent ones—and you'll always know where to move next. Ignore them, and you're guessing. The shouted riddles give you information but also alert enemies. Tactical choice."

She rolls up her notes.

> "Strategy: Track the focal point cycle—every four rounds, all shadows converge. Plan to be there. Use the riddles—silent ones are safe, shouted ones are risky but can help allies. Focus fire on the Salamanders first—*heat metal* is brutal. Save cold damage for the Efreeti if you have it. And for the love of the gods, DON'T stay in sunlight longer than you have to."

**Without intel purchase, Snak keeps it brief:**

> "You'll figure it out. Stay in shadows, chase them when they move, fight enemies who love fire. Want gear? My shop's open. Good luck not getting roasted."

### An Hour Before the Match in the Armory

The armory attendant offers fire resistance potions prominently.

> "For the sun, gladiators. Fire resistance potions—50 gold each, last one hour. Highly recommended. We also have healing potions, basic gear, and... well, you'll see."

The PCs can purchase:
- Potion of Fire Resistance (uncommon, 50 gp each)
- Potion of Healing (50 gp)
- Potion of Greater Healing (100 gp)
- Standard adventuring gear

### As You Walk Into the Arena

The gates open to blinding brightness. The arena floor is packed dirt, and suspended 80 feet overhead is a blazing orb—the Scorching Sun. Four massive spheres of varying sizes orbit slowly around the arena, casting moving shadows on the ground.

The heat is immediate and oppressive. You can feel your skin prickling.

The announcer's voice booms:

```
"CITIZENS OF TARSUS! Today we present—THE DANCE OF FIRE AND SHADOW!"

[The crowd roars]

"Five gladiators! One burning sun! Four moon-stones casting the only sanctuary!"

[The Scorching Sun pulses brighter, and the crowd shields their eyes]

"Behold the family: FATHER, MOTHER, BROTHER, and SISTER! Their shadows dance clockwise, turning every moment! Chase them—or BURN!"

[The moon-stones begin their slow rotation, shadows shifting across the arena floor]

"But our gladiators are not alone! Fire-born hunters await! Elementals of pure flame! Salamanders of molten fury! And the EFREETI ENFORCER, master of the inferno!"

[From opposite gates, fire-wreathed enemies emerge, their forms shimmering in the heat]

"The shadows move! The enemies strike! Solve the riddles! Find the stones! But above all—DANCE! DANCE with the shadows or BURN in the light!"

[A mystical voice echoes across the arena, the first riddle posed]

"Let the Blazing Shadows BEGIN!"

[The horn blasts. Initiative is rolled.]
```

The dance begins.

- Defeat all enemies while surviving the environmental hazard

**Sunlight Mechanics:**
- Start turn in sunlight: 2d6 fire damage (no save)
- Partial shadow: 1d6 fire damage
- Full shadow: No damage
- 5 cumulative rounds in sunlight: Gain 1 exhaustion (max 2)

**Shadow Movement:**
- Initiative count 20: All shadows rotate 30 feet clockwise
- Track positions using compass directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW)
- Father (40ft shadow), Mother (30ft), Brother (20ft), Sister (20ft)

**Focal Point Convergence:**
- Every 4 rounds: All shadows meet at arena center (50ft zone)
- Both PCs and enemies will fight for this position

**Riddles:**
- **Silent Riddles (5):** Solve quietly, learn shadow positions privately
- **Shouted Riddles (5):** Require Amplifying Stone (bonus action), reveal to all
- Solving riddles = predict shadow movement for next round
- Intelligence (Arcana) check DC 12 can also predict one shadow

**Amplifying Stones:**
- 3 total, DC 12 Perception to locate
- Using one makes your riddle answer audible to enemies
- Tactical risk/reward

**Enemy Priorities:**
- **Salamanders first** (*heat metal* is devastating)
- **Fire Elementals** will grapple and drag you into sun
- **Efreeti** stays airborne, uses *wall of fire*
- **Mephits** explode on death (fire hazard)

**Strategy Tips:**
- **Plan ahead:** Know where shadows will be next round
- **Use riddles:** Free information if you solve them
- **Coordinate:** Call out shadow positions to allies
- **Focal point:** Plan to reach arena center on convergence rounds (4, 8, 12, etc.)
- **Fire resistance:** Strongly recommended (potions available)
- **Cold damage:** Extra effective against fire enemies

Stay in the shadows. Dance with the sun. Survive.
