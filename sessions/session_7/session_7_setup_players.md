# Session 7 Setup: Blazing Shadows

### 3 Days After Session 6

The arena buzzes with talk of the Pygmy Wyvern hunt. Your team walked away victorious—bloodied, but victorious. The little creature has bonded with you, chirping happily in its cage back at the pen.

[[../../npcs/Snak|Snak]] shows up three days later, looking unusually serious.

> "Alright, listen up. You've done well so far—survived the night hunt, caught the Wyvern, built a reputation. The Grand Master's noticed. That's good and bad."

She pulls out a worn parchment with charred edges.

> "Session Seven. They're calling it 'Blazing Shadows.' Ever hear of the Scorching Sun arena configuration? No? Consider yourself lucky—until now."

She unfurls the parchment, showing a rough sketch.

> "Here's the deal: They're hanging a magical sun overhead. Not metaphorical—an actual captured fire elemental bound into an orb. It burns. Standing in direct sunlight deals fire damage every turn. Your only safety? The shadows cast by three floating moon-stones that orbit the arena."

She taps the sketch.

> "The shadows move. But here's the twist—they don't follow a simple pattern. The moon-stones shift in what looks random, but it's actually a hidden sequence. You'll need to chase the shadows while fighting fire-adapted enemies who LOVE the sun. It's a dance—miss a step and you burn."

She looks each of you in the eye.

> "They've also added something... theatrical. Riddles. Mystical voices will pose riddles during the fight. Solve them, and you'll know where the shadows move next. There are also Amplifying Stones scattered around—shout your answer using one, and everyone hears it. Allies AND enemies."

> "This one's level 4 recommended, but don't let that fool you. The environment's the real killer. Want intel? 25 gold for basics, 50 for the deep dive. Your call."

### The Night Before the Match

Snak returns with detailed notes if you paid for intel.

> "Right. Blazing Shadows breakdown."

> "The Scorching Sun hangs high up—can't reach it, can't destroy it. Three moon-stones orbit at 40 feet high, casting shadows on the ground."

She points to her notes.

> "The moon-stones aren't identical. Father's the biggest sphere, casts a ~40-foot shadow. Mother's 30-foot shadow. Child is 10-foot shadow. Here's the catch: they don't move in simple circles. They follow a pre-programmed pattern that looks random. Use compass directions to track them—North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, and CENTER."

> "Sunlight will burn like a fireball every while you're in it. Stay in sun too long and you become sluggish of mind and body on top of the burns.

> "The shadows overlap sometimes. Sometimes they'll converge at the arena center—50-foot safe zone. That's your focal point. Both you and the enemies will fight for that spot."

> "The riddles are specific to each round's movement. Some riddles are silent—solve them, you learn shadow positions privately. Others are shouted—you need an Amplifying Stone to yell the answer, and everyone hears it. Three stones scattered around the arena, hard but not impossible to spot them. They glow faintly when a shouted riddle is posed."

She flips her notes.

> "Enemies: Three Fire Elementals, immune to fire, they'll grapple you and drag you into sunlight. Two Salamanders, they use *heat metal* on armored targets, forcing you to choose between armor or burning. One Efreeti Enforcer... but a pretty scrawny one. Stays airborne, commands the elementals, uses fire to cut off escape routes. Possibly four Magma Mephits—weak individually, but their death burst creates fire hazards."

> "The riddles are your edge. Solve them correctly—especially the silent ones—and you'll always know where to move next. Ignore them, and you're guessing. The shouted riddles give you information but also alert enemies. Tactical choice."

She rolls up her notes.

> "Strategy: Track the focal point cycle - it should be repetitive. Plan to be there. Use the riddles—they're your key to predicting the pattern. Silent ones are safe, shouted ones are risky but can help allies. Focus fire on the Salamanders first—*heat metal* is brutal. Save cold damage for the Efreeti if you have it. And for the love of the gods, DON'T stay in sunlight longer than you have to."

Want gear? My shop's open. Good luck not getting roasted."

### As You Walk Into the Arena

The gates open to blinding brightness. The arena floor is packed dirt, and suspended 80 feet overhead is a blazing orb—the Scorching Sun. Three massive spheres of varying sizes orbit slowly around the arena, casting moving shadows on the ground.

The heat is immediate and oppressive. You can feel your skin prickling.

The announcer's voice booms:

```
"CITIZENS OF TARSUS! Today we present—THE DANCE OF FIRE AND SHADOW!"

[The crowd roars]

"Five gladiators! One burning sun! Four moon-stones casting the only sanctuary!"

[The Scorching Sun pulses brighter, and the crowd shields their eyes]

"Behold the family: FATHER, MOTHER, BROTHER, and SISTER! Their shadows dance clockwise, turning every moment! Chase them—or BURN!"

[The moon-stones begin their slow rotation, shadows shifting across the arena floor]

"But our gladiators are not alone! Fire-born hunters await! Elementals of pure flame! Salamanders of molten fury! And the EFREETI ENFORCER, master of the inferno!"

[From opposite gates, fire-wreathed enemies emerge, their forms shimmering in the heat]

"The shadows move! The enemies strike! Solve the riddles! Find the stones! But above all—DANCE! DANCE with the shadows or BURN in the light!"

[A mystical voice echoes across the arena, the first riddle posed]

"Let the Blazing Shadows BEGIN!"

[The horn blasts. Initiative is rolled.]
```

The dance begins.
