# Session 2 Setup: Pre-Arena Vignettes

## Vignette 1: Snak's Briefing

**Setting:** The kennels beneath the Arena. The stone walls are damp, torches flicker in their sconces. The distant roar of the crowd above is a constant rumble. Snak stands near a weapon rack, arms crossed over her leather vest, her tusks catching the firelight.

The party stands before her, along with Merryn (who's checking her bowstring with practiced ease), Kael (a young man in his early twenties, nervous energy radiating off him as he adjusts his shield), and Sienna (an older woman with graying red hair and scars crossing her forearms).

"Alright. Listen up, and listen well. I don't repeat myself."


"Today's entertainment is the Gauntlet. Three zones. Three waves. Ten rounds." She holds up a thick, calloused finger for emphasis. "You see that hourglass they're setting up? When those sands run out, they release the reserves. And trust me—" She leans forward. "—you do *not* want to see what's in those cages."

"Zone One: The Scrap. Four goblins. They're weak, but they're *annoying*. Two have nets, two have bows. They'll try to tie you up, literally. Kill them fast. Don't get fancy. Speed matters more than style here."

"Zone Two: The Breach. Two hobgoblins. Not like the goblins—these are *soldiers*. Chain mail, shields, and they work together. They'll form a shield wall." She makes a blocking gesture with her forearms. "If you let them stay together, they'll gut you with teamwork. Separate them, flank them, or hit them with everything you've got all at once."

"Expected time:Don't rush stupidly, but don't dawdle either. You should be halfway through your timer when you finish Zone Two."

"Zone Three: The Pit."

"Bonecrusher."

Snak's voice is flat. "He's killed *eleven* gladiators in the last two months. They keep him chained to a center post—fifteen-foot chain, so he's got a thirty-foot range from the middle. Stay outside that range if you can."

She looks directly at the more aggressive fighters in the group.

"If you get hit by Bonecrusher, you *will* go down. Maybe dead, maybe dying. His club is bigger than most of you." She lets that sink in. "Use ranged attacks if you have them. Kite him. Make him chase shadows."

"What about the chain?" asks one of the PCs.

Snak's mouth twists into something that might be a smile, but isn't pleasant. "At half health, he goes berserk. He'll try to break it." She meets their eyes. "Just a question of strength check. If he rolls well, he breaks free. And then..." She shrugs. "Then you're fighting an angry, wounded, *mobile* ogre. And the crowd will *love* it."

Silence for a moment.

"Here's my advice, and I'll only say it once: **Move fast, hit hard, don't get fancy in the first two zones.** Save your big tricks and your resources for Bonecrusher. The crowd wants speed and blood. Give them both."

She pauses, scanning their faces.

## Vignette 2: The Announcer's Introduction

**Setting:** The Arena floor. The party has just walked through the massive iron gates, which clang shut behind them with a finality that echoes off stone. The crowd is already roaring—thousands of voices, a living wall of sound. The sand beneath their feet is clean, freshly raked.

At the far end of the Arena, three sets of gates stand closed: one near them (Zone 1), one in the middle distance (Zone 2), and one at the far end where a massive post stands (Zone 3). Off to the side, visible to everyone, arena workers are positioning an enormous hourglass—easily eight feet tall, filled with black sand.

Above them, on a raised platform draped in imperial purple, stands the Announcer. He's a broad-shouldered man in a gold-trimmed toga, his voice magically amplified to fill every corner of the Arena. His arms are spread wide, soaking in the crowd's energy.

---

The crowd's roar builds to a crescendo. The Announcer lets it wash over him, then raises one hand.

Silence falls like a blade.

"**CITIZENS OF TARSUS!**"

His voice booms across the Arena, rich and theatrical.

"**NOBLES AND PATRIOTS! MERCHANTS AND SOLDIERS!**"

He sweeps his arm toward the luxury boxes where senators and wealthy patrons sit in silk and jewels.

"**WELCOME... TO THE ARENA!**"

The crowd explodes in cheers. He lets it build for a moment, then his voice drops—intimate, conspiratorial, but still amplified to every seat.

"Tonight..."

A pause. The crowd leans in.

"Tonight, we test not just *strength*..."

He holds up a clenched fist.

"...but **SPEED.**"

Another pause. His voice rises again.

"Not just *courage*..."

He thumps his chest.

"...but **CUNNING!**"

He spins, his toga flaring dramatically, and gestures toward the massive hourglass. Arena workers tip it, and the black sand begins to flow with terrible, inexorable slowness.

"**BEHOLD! THE GAUNTLET OF THE CONDEMNED!**"

The crowd roars. He waits for it to quiet just slightly, then continues, his voice building in intensity.

"Three zones! Three trials! **Ten rounds!**"

He holds up ten fingers, then slowly closes them into fists.

"When these sands run dry, when the last grain falls..."

He points dramatically at the side cages near Zone 3. They rattle. Something *growls* from within.

"...**WE RELEASE WHAT HUNGERS IN THE DARK!**"

Gasps and excited shouts from the crowd. Someone screams in delight. The Announcer grins, predatory and showman all at once.

"But let us not get ahead of ourselves! First, our gladiators must prove they *deserve* to fear what waits in those cages!"

He turns to the first gate—Zone 1.

"In the Scrap—"

The gate rattles.

"—goblins wait with nets and malice! Small, yes! Weak, perhaps! But *numerous*, and clever, and *very* motivated to survive!"

He gestures toward Zone 2.

"In the Breach—"

That gate *clangs* as something heavy strikes it from behind.

"—hobgoblin steel stands ready! The legions of the East, brought low by Empire and *desperate* to prove their worth! They will show you what discipline and formation can do to flesh and bone!"

The crowd is buzzing now, excited, bloodthirsty.

The Announcer turns slowly toward Zone 3. His voice drops again, and somehow that makes it more powerful.

"And in the Pit..."

Thunder rumbles—magic, staged, but effective. A spotlight illuminates the center post, the thick iron chain, and the massive shape standing in the shadows behind the gate.

"...**BONECRUSHER.**"

The name echoes. Someone in the crowd shouts, "ELEVEN! ELEVEN!" Others pick it up. A chant starts: "BONE-CRUSH-ER! BONE-CRUSH-ER!"

The Announcer lets it build, then raises both hands for silence.

"Yes! *Eleven!* Eleven gladiators have fallen to his club! Eleven warriors thought they were strong enough, fast enough, *lucky* enough!"

He leans forward, as if sharing a secret with the entire Arena.

"They were not."

He straightens, voice rising to a crescendo.

"But tonight! Tonight, Bonecrusher is *chained*—fifteen feet of iron to keep the beast at bay! Tonight, our gladiators have a chance!"

A pause.

"If they are *fast* enough!"

He gestures to the hourglass, where the sand is already visibly lower.

"If they are *strong* enough!"

He pounds his fist against his palm.

"If they are *ruthless* enough!"

His voice reaches a fever pitch.

"**GLADIATORS!**"

He points at the party.

"You stand on the sands where legends are born and cowards are *buried*! You face the Gauntlet! You dance with death itself! And we—"

He sweeps his arm across the entire crowd.

"—**WE** are here to see if you are WORTHY!"

The crowd erupts. Deafening cheers, stomping feet, the crash of thousands of voices shouting at once.

The Announcer spreads his arms wide, basking in it. Then he points at the first gate.

It begins to rise with a grinding, metallic groan.

Four pairs of yellow eyes gleam in the darkness beyond.

The Announcer's voice cuts through the noise one final time:

"**SHOW US YOU CAN DANCE WITH DEATH!**"

The hourglass continues to drain.

"**SHOW US YOU DESERVE TO LIVE!**"

The gate is halfway up now. The goblins are visible, crouched and ready, nets in hand.

A massive gong sounds—deep, resonant, final.

The Announcer throws his arms forward.

"**LET THE GAUNTLET... BEGIN!**"

The crowd *screams.*

And from the shadows of Zone 1, the goblins charge.
