# Session 2 Encounter: The Gauntlet Run

## Party Composition
- 5 Level 2 Player Characters
- Merryn (Elf Archer NPC - established character)
- 2-3 Additional Disposable NPC Gladiators

---

## Encounter Overview: The Gauntlet Run

**Theme:** Speed, endurance, and crowd-pleasing momentum

**Core Concept:** The Arena has been divided into three distinct zones, each with progressively deadlier enemies. A massive hourglass stands at the edge of the arena, visible to all - when the sands run out (10 combat rounds), gates open and release additional monsters that will overwhelm the party. The crowd LOVES speed and efficiency. This is about survival AND entertainment.

**Victory Condition:** Defeat all three zones before time expires
**Failure Condition:** Timer expires while enemies remain (reinforcements arrive)

**Time Pressure:**
- Expected clear time: 4-5 rounds (this is the longest fight)
- At Round 8 total (if reached): Announcer warns time is almost up
- At Round 10: Timer expires, side cages open automatically
- Reinforcements: 4 more Goblins + 1 Hobgoblin (likely TPK if this happens)

**Ogre Special Mechanic: BREAKING FREE**
- At 30 HP (half health): Ogre goes berserk, STR check to break chain
- +6 to the roll, needs 15+ to break free

- Let the Ogre break free and STILL kill it: **+3 Favor to killing blow**

**NPC Behavior:**

---

## NPC Allies Detailed

### Merryn (Established Character)
**Statblock: Scout**
- HP: 16
- AC: 13
- Attacks: Longbow +4 (1d8+2), 80/320 range
- Special: Keen Hearing and Sight (advantage on Perception)
- Personality: Confident, loves the spotlight, will take credit for kills

**Behavior:**
- Stays at range, focuses fire on wounded enemies
- Will spend her turn inspiring (Help action) if someone has a dramatic kill setup
- Survives - she's too important to the story
- Post-fight will either praise PCs ("You made me look good!") or criticize ("Sloppy, but we survived")

### Disposable NPCs (Choose 2-3)

**1. Kael "The Bull"** (Guard statblock, HP 11, AC 16)
- Young, eager to prove himself
- Sword and board fighter
- Will charge into Zone 1 recklessly
- 60% chance dies to Ogre (takes the big hit meant for a PC)

**2. Sienna Redhand** (Thug statblock, HP 32, AC 11)
- Grizzled, been here before
- Heavy mace and attitude
- Stays with the group, tactical
- 40% chance dies to Hobgoblin Martial Advantage

**3. "Lucky" Tam** (Bandit statblock, HP 11, AC 12)
- Nervous, doesn't want to be here (conscripted)
- Scimitar, light armor
- Will flee if Ogre breaks chain (Constitution save DC 12 or drops weapon and runs)
- 30% chance dies if he panics and runs (crowd throws rocks, announcer signals guards)

**Recommendation:** Use Kael + Sienna, keep it to 2 NPCs so action economy isn't overwhelming

---

## Timer Mechanics

### The Hourglass
- Massive prop visible to entire arena
- Sand drains 1/10th per round
- Announcer calls out time at rounds 5, 8, 9
- Visual pressure for players

### Round-by-Round Pressure

| Round | Timer Status | Announcer Call |
|-------|--------------|----------------|
| 1-2 | Full → 80% | "The Gauntlet begins! Ten rounds, three zones, GLORY AWAITS!" |
| 3-4 | 70% → 50% | "They're making progress! But can they maintain the pace?" |
| 5 | 50% | "HALFWAY! The monsters in the side cages are getting HUNGRY!" |
| 6-7 | 40% → 30% | Tension building, crowd noise increases |
| 8 | 20% | "TWO ROUNDS! The cages are rattling! FINISH THEM!" |
| 9 | 10% | "ONE ROUND REMAINS! WILL THEY MAKE IT?!" |
| 10 | EXPIRED | "TIME'S UP! RELEASE THE RESERVES!" (Failure condition) |

## Snak's Pre-Fight Briefing

**Setting:** Back in the kennels, Snak leans against a weapon rack, arms crossed

"Alright, listen up. Today's the Gauntlet. You've got three waves, and you've got *maybe* ten minutes before they release the reserves. And trust me, you don't want to see what's in those cages."

She points at Merryn. "You've got the elf. She's good, she's fast, and she knows when to shoot. Don't waste her."

Gestures to Kael/Sienna. "These two are... adequate. They'll fight. Whether they'll survive? Up to you."

"Here's my advice: **Move fast, hit hard, don't get fancy in the first two zones.** Goblins are annoying but weak - clear them quick. Hobgoblins are tougher - separate them or you'll regret it."

"The Ogre..." *she grimaces* "Bonecrusher's killed eleven gladiators. He's chained, which helps. Stay outside his range, ranged attacks are your friend. The handlers will try to waste your time and release reinforcements. **Kill them first.**"

"And if Bonecrusher breaks that chain?" *She meets their eyes.* "Pray to whatever gods you believe in, spread out so he can't hit multiple people, and drop him FAST."

**Equipment Options:**
- Healing Potion (50 GP) - 2d4+2 HP
- Alchemist's Fire (50 GP) - good against Ogre
- Net (1 GP) - for goblin handlers
- 10ft Pole (5 CP) - stay out of Ogre range
- Manacles (2 GP) - "If you get creative with the chain..."

"Now get out there. Make it quick, make it bloody, and make me some money."

## Announcer Dialogue

### Opening (Pre-Combat)

```
[The crowd's roar builds to a crescendo as the party enters the arena]

"CITIZENS OF TARSUS! NOBLES AND PATRIOTS!"

[Dramatic pause, then the Announcer's voice drops, intimate and deadly]

"Tonight... we test not just strength, but SPEED. Not just courage, but CUNNING!"

[Gestures to the hourglass, which begins to tip]

"BEHOLD! THE GAUNTLET OF THE CONDEMNED! Three zones! Ten rounds! And if our brave gladiators cannot clear the field before these sands run dry..."

[Points to the rattling side cages]

"...we release what hungers in the DARK!"

[Pauses, lets tension build]

"In the Scrap, goblins wait with nets and malice!
In the Breach, hobgoblin steel stands ready!
And in the Pit..."

[Thunder sound effect, dramatic lighting on Zone 3]

"...BONECRUSHER THE OGRE, chained but never tamed, awaits his TWELFTH VICTIM!"

[Raises arms]

"Gladiators! Show us you can dance with death! Show us you deserve to LIVE!"

[Gong sounds]

"LET THE GAUNTLET... BEGIN!"
```

### Mid-Fight Callouts

**After Zone 1 cleared (Round 2-3):**
```
"First blood to our challengers! But speed counts as much as steel! Can they maintain this pace?!"
```

**After Zone 2 cleared (Round 5-6):**
```
"The hobgoblin line has FALLEN! But the sands run low! And now... they face the BEAST!"
```

**Ogre at Half-Health:**
```
"BONECRUSHER BLEEDS! But a wounded beast is a DANGEROUS beast! Will the chain hold?!"
```

**If Ogre Breaks Free:**
```
[Crowd goes absolutely wild - screams, cheers, gasps]

"BY THE GODS! HE'S FREE! HE'S FREE! RUN OR FIGHT, GLADIATORS! SHOW US YOUR WORTH!"
```

**Round 8 Warning:**
```
"TWO ROUNDS REMAIN! The reserves are HUNGRY! FINISH IT!"
```

**Victory (Before Round 10):**
```
[Bonecrusher falls, crowd erupts]

"THE BEAST FALLS! THE GAUNTLET IS CONQUERED! And with time to spare!"

[Checks hourglass]

"[X] rounds remaining! Speed AND strength! These gladiators have EARNED their blood money!"

[If anyone had notable moments]

"Did you SEE [Character Name] [cool thing they did]?! THAT is why we come to the ARENA!"
```

### Victory Declaration

```
[Party standing amid the carnage, timer stopped]

"Champions of the Gauntlet! You faced the Scrap! You broke the Breach! You brought low BONECRUSHER HIMSELF!"

[Crowd chanting, picking favorites]

"The crowd has spoken! Your names will be REMEMBERED!"

[Gestures to one of the luxury boxes]

"And it seems... you have drawn the eye of INTERESTED PARTIES..."

[A figure in fine robes is visible watching intently, then departs]

"Collect your rewards, gladiators. You have EARNED tonight's rest. But the Arena is never satisfied... and next week, the challenges will be GREATER still!"

[Crowd cheers as party is escorted out]
```

---

## Consequence Hooks (Choose One)

### 1. The Patron's Invitation
A servant in fine livery approaches in the kennels:

"My master, Senator Caius Argentum, requests your presence tomorrow evening. He has a... proposition for gladiators of your particular talents. The invitation is not optional, but the rewards will be considerable."

**Leads to:** Patron quest line, political intrigue, special equipment access

### 2. The Survivor's Grudge
If Tam fled and survived the crowd's wrath:

That night, he's found in his cell, beaten and bruised. "The crowd doesn't forget cowardice," Snak says flatly. "Neither do I. He's done here. They'll sell him to the mines."

As he's dragged away, he locks eyes with the party: "This place... it changes you. Don't let it."

**Leads to:** Moral questions about the Arena, potential escape plot, Snak relationship development

### 3. The Trainer's Respect
Snak finds them after, rare approval in her eyes:

"Not bad. Bonecrusher's been a problem for months. You did that efficiently." She pauses. "I'm authorized to offer veterans access to the *special* equipment room. Costs more, but it might keep you alive. And alive gladiators make me money."

**Leads to:** Better equipment access, Snak becomes an actual ally, trainer relationship questline

### 4. The Rival's Challenge
Another gladiator, a veteran, watches from the kennels entrance:

He's massive, scarred, clearly dangerous. He nods slowly. "Impressive. I was wondering when some new blood would be worth my time. Name's Varro. Remember it. Because next time we're in that arena together..." *He smiles, not friendly.* "...we won't be on the same side."

**Leads to:** Rival gladiator storyline, future dramatic combat, potential ally or enemy

---

## DM Notes & Adjustments

### If Players Are Struggling
- Have Merryn make clutch shots (finish wounded enemies)
- Reduce Ogre HP by 10-15
- Goblin handlers flee instead of fighting to death
- Give them 1 extra round (11 total instead of 10)

### If Players Are Dominating
- Ogre breaks chain at 40 HP instead of 30 HP
- Goblin handlers successfully unlock ONE cage early (2 extra goblins)
- Hobgoblins have Longbows and kite backwards while maintaining formation
- Timer is 9 rounds instead of 10

### Expected Difficulty
- **Zone 1:** Easy, warm-up
- **Zone 2:** Moderate, first real challenge
- **Zone 3:** Hard, legitimate risk of PC death from Ogre hits

**Total CR Budget:** Approximately CR 4-5 encounter for 5 Level 2 PCs, which is Deadly but manageable with time pressure adding urgency rather than additional lethality.

### Pacing Tips
1. **Keep combat moving** - Timer is visual pressure, don't let players deliberate too long
2. **Describe the hourglass** - Every few rounds, mention how much sand remains
3. **Announcer commentary** - Use it to maintain energy and spotlight cool moments
4. **NPC actions** - Pre-roll or use average damage to speed their turns
5. **Death is possible** - Make the Ogre scary. If someone goes down, play it dramatic

- [ ] Prep hourglass visual or timer method
- [ ] Prepare arena map (zones marked clearly)

---

### Option 2: The Beast and Its Masters
**Theme:** Target priority and environmental awareness

**Setup:**
A trained Owlbear is released with its handler-trainers. The beast is savage but responds to commands. The trainers use it tactically while staying out of direct combat. Arena floor has scattered obstacles (pillars, weapon racks, partial walls).

**Enemies:**
- **1 Owlbear** (CR 3) - The main threat, very dangerous at Level 2
- **3 Beast Handlers** (use Scout statblock, CR 1/2 each) - Stay at range, command the beast, use nets/bolas to disable PCs

**NPC Support:**
- Merryn (Archer, if she wasn't present in Session 2) OR
- Rohm + 1 of the young steppes folk (Tovo?) - Rohm will protect the youth at all costs

**Tactical Elements:**
- Handlers can use their action to command the Owlbear to attack a specific target or use its multiattack
- If all handlers are eliminated, Owlbear goes berserk (attacks nearest creature, including other enemies)
- Pillars can be used for cover or knocked over (Athletics check) to create difficult terrain

**Crowd Mechanics:**
- Taking down a handler dramatically (Panache kill): +1 Favor
- Surviving an Owlbear hit and staying up: +1 Favor
- Turning the Owlbear against its handlers: +2 Favor to whoever orchestrates it

**Drama Hooks:**
- NPC support character gets grabbed by Owlbear - save them or let them die?
- Handlers offer to call off the beast if the PCs yield (lose all Favor but survive)
- Crowd favorite can spend 3 Favor to have crowd throw a chain to restrain the Owlbear (contested Strength check)

---

### Option 3: Traitors in the Ranks
**Theme:** Trust, betrayal, and social combat meets physical combat

**Setup:**
The party is paired with 3-4 NPC gladiators for a "team battle" against another group. Midway through, some NPCs reveal they've been bribed/threatened to turn on the party. Classic arena betrayal.

**Initial Enemy Team:**
- 5 Enemy Gladiators (mix of Guard and Thug statblocks)
- 1 Enemy Champion (Veteran statblock, CR 3 - but injured, starts at half HP)

**NPC "Allies" (3-4 total):**
- 2 will betray mid-fight (after round 3 or when Champion drops below 25% HP)
- 1-2 stay loyal (one might be Rohm or another established NPC)

**Combat Flow:**
- Rounds 1-3: Standard team vs team arena battle
- Round 3-4: Betrayal trigger - announcer reveals "plot twist," traitors attack nearest PC
- Rounds 4+: Chaos - some enemies might even attack the traitors, crowd goes wild

**Crowd Mechanics:**
- This is PEAK DRAMA for the crowd
- Surviving betrayal: +2 Favor
- Killing a traitor with Panache: +1 Favor
- Protecting a loyal NPC from betrayer: +1 Favor
- If PCs somehow saw it coming and turn it to their advantage: +3 Favor

**Drama Hooks:**
- One traitor might show reluctance, can be persuaded to switch back (Persuasion DC 15)
- Enemy Champion respects the "honor" and might aid PCs against traitors
- A patron in the stands makes it clear: "Those who survive this with grace will have my support"
- Loyal NPC might die protecting a PC, creating emotional weight

---

### Option 4: The Condemned Sacrifice
**Theme:** Moral choice and asymmetric combat

**Setup:**
The party + NPC allies face a group of condemned prisoners who've been armed and promised freedom if they win. The prisoners aren't warriors - they're desperate people who don't want to die. Some might be families, elderly, or injured. But they've been given numbers and rudimentary weapons.

**Enemies:**
- 8-10 Prisoners (use Commoner statblock with clubs/improvised weapons)
- 2 "Leaders" among the prisoners (Bandits, CR 1/8) - slightly more capable
- 1 Guard overseer with whip who drives them forward from the edge

**Twist:**
- Some prisoners will surrender if given the chance
- Others fight desperately to protect family members in the group
- The crowd's reaction depends on HOW the PCs handle it - mercy or brutality?
- Rohm and the steppes youth are watching from the kennels - this hits close to home

**Crowd Mechanics:**
- This is tricky: Different crowd members want different things
- Brutal efficiency might gain Favor from bloodthirsty nobles
- Showing mercy/sparing lives might gain Favor from common folk
- Creative non-lethal solutions gain Favor from theatrical patrons
- Taking too long or appearing weak loses Favor

**Combat Twist:**
After the prisoners are handled (killed/subdued/surrendered), the REAL fight begins:
- 1 Gladiator Champion (Veteran, CR 3) descends: "Let me show you how it's REALLY done!"
- He's fresh, they're worn down from the first fight
- This is about testing their endurance and decision-making under pressure

**Drama Hooks:**
- One prisoner is someone from a PC's background
- Snak is watching - she'll remember who showed mercy vs. who showed cruelty
- A powerful Senator is in attendance - their opinion matters for future patronage
- The survivors (if any) might become recurring NPCs

---

## Recommended Encounter: Option 2 or 3

**Option 2 (Beast and Masters)** provides:
- Clear tactical challenge

- Environmental interaction
- NPC support that creates stakes
