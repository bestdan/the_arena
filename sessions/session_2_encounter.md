## Arena Layout

**Arena Size:** 60 ft diameter circle

```
           [Wall Spikes - North]
              ║ ║ ║ ║ ║

[Quicksand]     OGRE        [Quicksand]
   (West)    Master1  Master2   (East)
    ≋≋≋     Hyena Hyena Hyena    ≋≋≋
     ≋        Hyena               ≋


           [Starting Gate]
              (South)
           PARTY ENTERS
```

---

## Environmental Hazards

### Wall Spikes (North side)
- Any creature pushed/thrown into spikes: **DC 12 Dex save** or **2d6 piercing damage**
- Creates danger zone for forced movement effects
- Great for Panache moments (shoving enemies into spikes)

### Quicksand Patches (2x 10ft diameter areas, West and East)
- **Difficult terrain** - costs 2 ft of movement per 1 ft moved
- Creature starting turn in quicksand: **DC 12 Str save** or **restrained** until escape
- Escaping: Action, **DC 12 Athletics check**
- Even if not restrained, half movement to traverse
- Tactical value: Can kite ogre through it, trap controllers, dramatic rescues

---

## Starting Positions

**Enemy Deployment:**
- **Ogre:** Center-north, 10 ft from wall spikes
- **Hyena Master 1:** West side, 5 ft from western quicksand
- **Hyena Master 2:** East side, 5 ft from eastern quicksand
- **Hyenas:** 2 near each master, scattered flanking positions

**Party Entry:**
- South gate opens
- Party can spend 1 round forming up before initiative if desired
- Suggests Gladiator + Rohm creating defensive line for kids

---

## Tactical Breakdown

### Enemy Strategy

**Opening (Rounds 1-2):**
- Hyenas dash forward to harass and threaten kids
- Masters advance to whip range, begin controlling space
- Ogre advances menacingly but doesn't overcommit

**Mid-Fight (Rounds 3-5):**
- Hyenas swarm, focusing Pack Tactics on isolated targets
- Masters use whips to disarm/trip, drive PCs toward hazards
- Ogre engages primary threats or tries to break through to kill kids
- If anyone goes down, hyenas use Rampage to finish them

**Endgame (Rounds 6+):**
- Hyenas likely dead or mostly dead
- Masters become vulnerable, may try to flee or surrender
- Ogre fights to the death, chance for dramatic finish

### Party Optimal Strategy

**Defensive Formation:**
- Gladiator anchors center with Shield of Righteous Martyr (+1 AC to allies within 5 ft)
- Rohm guards opposite flank
- Kids stay between them, use spear reach to attack without exposing
- Merryn takes elevated position or kites from range

**Offensive:**
- Focus-fire hyenas first (low HP, removes action economy advantage)
- Use environmental hazards offensively (shove enemies)
- Control the masters before they control you
- Kite/control ogre last, it's slow and can be managed

**Key Resources:**
- Gladiator's Martyr's Intervention (5/day) - save kids from dying
- Crowd's Favor mechanics - build up early on hyenas
- Merryn's archery - take out hyenas efficiently
- Environmental hazards - maximize Panache opportunities

---

## Panache Opportunities

**High-Value Moments:**
- ⚔️ **Shoving enemies into wall spikes** - Visceral, crowd loves it
- 🎯 **Merryn's precision shots** - Taking hyena mid-leap, shooting whip from hand
- 🛡️ **Gladiator protecting allies** - Using Martyr's Intervention dramatically
- 💀 **Finishing moves on hyenas** - Low HP makes them perfect for spectacular kills
- 🌪️ **Using quicksand tactically** - Shoving ogre in, rescuing allies
- ⚡ **Spear formations** - Kids working together to bring down larger foe
- 🎪 **Environmental mastery** - Backflipping off wall spikes, swinging around obstacles

**Crowd's Favor Build-Up:**
- Early hyena kills = easy Panache successes = Favor accumulation
- Multiple PCs can get "Hot Crowd" status
- Save big Favor spends for critical moments (protecting kids, ogre finish)

---

## Expected Flow

**Round 1-2: Chaos Erupts**
- Hyenas rush in, fast and threatening
- Masters crack whips, control battlefield
- Ogre lumber-charges forward
- Party must form defensive position FAST
- Kids immediately in danger

**Round 3-4: Desperate Defense**
- Ogre engages, massive threat
- Hyenas swarming, Pack Tactics everywhere
- Gladiator + Rohm anchoring defensive line
- Merryn picking off targets
- Resources being spent (Martyr's Intervention, Favor)

**Round 5-6: Tide Turns**
- Hyenas dropping, action economy shifts
- Masters becoming vulnerable
- Ogre bloodied but still dangerous
- Party gaining confidence

**Round 7+: Heroic Finish**
- Cleanup phase
- Opportunity for dramatic Panache finisher on ogre
- Kids have survived (barely)
- Crowd going wild

---

## Scaling Options

### Too Easy?
- **Add scimitar fighters mid-combat** - "The arena gates open again! Two more fighters rush in!"
- **Ogre gets second wind** - When bloodied, regains 2d8+4 HP (once)
- **Masters coordinate better** - Both focus on disarming/tripping same target

### Too Hard?
- **Merryn goes nova** - She starts using Crowd's Favor aggressively, showing off
- **Snak interferes** - "Accidentally" drops caltrops/nets from viewing box on enemies
- **Hyenas flee** - After losing 2-3, remaining hyenas break and run
- **Kids play dead** - After going down once, they stay down (stable) instead of being targeted

### Kids Going Down?
- **This is expected** - Makes protecting them heroic
- **Martyr's Intervention exists for this**
- **Rohm will go berserk** - If kid drops, he gains advantage on all attacks until kid is stable
- **Crowd's Favor helps** - "The Chant Rises" can give advantage on death saves

---

## Victory Conditions

**Minimum Success:**
- Ogre defeated
- Majority of enemies defeated/fled
- All kids survive (even if unconscious)
- PCs survive

**Optimal Success:**
- All enemies defeated
- All allies survive and conscious
- Multiple Panache moments
- High Crowd's Favor accumulation
- Rohm's debt earned

**Consequences:**
- Scouts in audience notice standout performers
- Snak is satisfied, will help move kids tomorrow
- Rohm's favor = future story hook
- Crowd reputation increased

---

## Post-Combat Notes

**Rewards from Snak:**
- Payment for keeping kids alive
- Possible additional equipment if performance was exceptional
- Information about scouts/patrons who noticed

**Rohm's Gratitude:**
- Future ally in the pens
- Connections to steppe horse people (potential story hook)
- Will protect party members if needed

**Crowd Impression:**
- Base on number of Panache successes
- Protecting weak = some crowd love it (honor), others bored (bloodthirst)
- Spectacular kills = always popular
- Environmental use = clever, gets attention

**Injuries/Exhaustion:**
- Track who went down
- Who used most resources
- Sets up inter-session recovery/relationships
