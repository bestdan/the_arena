## The Impossible Odds: Four Escalating Stages

---

## Last Stand Mechanics for This Encounter

When a PC drops to 0 HP, they should activate [[last_stand|Last Stand]]. This is what the crowd came to see.

### Enhanced Last Stand Favor (Special for The Rite)
- **Activating Last Stand:** +3 Favor (automatic)
- **Declaring dramatic final action:** +2 Favor if successful
- **Killing an enemy during Last Stand:** +3 Favor
- **Using [[panache|Panache]] during Last Stand:** +2 Favor on success
- **Protecting ally during Last Stand:** +3 Favor
- **Spectacular death (GM discretion):** +1-5 Favor based on drama

### Tracking Last Stands
Each PC should get opportunity to activate Last Stand. Pace damage to allow it. NPCs will also use Last Stand—show examples early.

**NPC Last Stand Examples:**
- **Zara:** Frenzy rage, charges the Chimera, dual handaxe whirlwind
- **Fennec:** Backflip onto Pit Champion's shoulders, dual dagger stab, theatrical collapse
- **Kael:** Shields three allies with Rally, takes killing blow meant for them
- **Merryn:** Impossible trickshot through two enemies, winks at crowd before falling
- **Rohm:** Spear throw that pins Beast Handler to pillar, dies standing

---

## Tracking Favor

**Critical:** The person with LOWEST favor at end of combat stays dead permanently.

### GM Responsibilities
- Track Favor visibly (use index cards, tokens, or tally marks)
- Remind players frequently about Favor opportunities
- Encourage spreading spotlight—teamwork prevents permanent death
- Call out Favor gains loud and clear: "That ignite gives you +1 Favor!"
- Warn if someone is falling behind: "You're at 2 Favor—everyone else is 5+"

### Expected Favor Range
By end of combat, most should have 12-20 Favor if playing smart:
- Stage 1 kills/actions: 3-5 Favor
- Stage 2 beast fighting: 3-5 Favor
- Stage 3 surviving Champion: 3-5 Favor
- Last Stand activation: 3+ Favor
- Last Stand actions: 3-8 Favor
- Environmental/team play: 2-4 Favor

### Lowest Favor Consequence
Whoever ends with lowest Favor does not resurrect. If tied for lowest, **both** stay dead (or roll off, GM choice based on drama).

This should feel earned—if someone hogged spotlight, showboated alone, or ignored team play, they're at risk.

---

## Expected Combat Flow

**Rounds 1-3: Chaos and Formation**
- Stage 1 enemies swarm in
- Party forms defensive positions
- Champions and Brutes test the line
- First blood drawn, first Favor gained
- Battlefield control established

**Rounds 4-5: The Beast Arrives**
- Chimera descends, game changes
- Fire breath forces repositioning
- Some PCs may go down—opportunity for first Last Stands
- Handlers harass from range
- Favor accumulation accelerates

**Rounds 6-7: The Executioner**
- Pit Champion enters, lethality spikes
- Poison damage drains resources
- More PCs dropping, more Last Stands
- Desperate plays for Favor
- Teamwork becomes critical

**Rounds 8-10: The End**
- Reinforcements keep pressure on
- Final Last Stands triggered
- Spectacular deaths
- Last PC falls
- Silence... then resurrection

---

## The Phoenix Resurrection

Once all eight combatants are dead:

[The crowd falls silent]

[The obsidian pillars flare with blinding white-gold light]

[The resurrection runes ignite, one by one]

[The phoenix brazier erupts in golden flame that spreads across the arena]

**The Grand Master's voice booms:**

> "BEHOLD—THE PHOENIX ACKNOWLEDGES COURAGE!"

[Seven bodies glow with golden light and rise, wounds closing, breath returning]

[One body remains still, dark, lifeless]

> "Seven have EARNED their return! Seven proved WORTHY of the flames!"

[The crowd erupts in cheers for the seven]

[Silence falls for the one who remains dead]

> "One has fallen SHORT. The Phoenix does not grant mercy—only justice."

### Resurrection Quality (Based on Final Favor)

For the **seven who return**:

**0-5 Favor:** 
- Basic resurrection
- Return with 1 level of exhaustion (lasts until next long rest)
- Equipment intact but damaged (cosmetic)

**6-10 Favor:**
- Clean resurrection
- Full HP, no exhaustion
- Equipment repaired and polished

**11-15 Favor:**
- Resurrection with vigor
- Full HP, no exhaustion
- Advantage on first attack or save next session
- Equipment enhanced (minor cosmetic upgrade)

**16-20 Favor:**
- Phoenix blessing
- Full HP, no exhaustion  
- Choose one permanent boon:
  - +1 to a single skill proficiency
  - +5 max HP
  - Phoenix Trinket (grants 1 reroll per long rest)
- Equipment blessed (glows faintly in firelight)

**21+ Favor:**
- Champion of the Phoenix
- All benefits of 16-20 tier
- Phoenix Mark (visible tattoo/brand that grants advantage on Intimidation or Performance checks when visible)
- The crowd knows your name—+2 to all future Favor gains for next three sessions

### The One Who Stays Dead

The character with lowest Favor does not resurrect. Their body is removed from the arena by attendants in black robes. The Grand Master offers no words for them.

**Consequences:**
- Player rolls new character OR rotates in a different PC from their roster (campaign uses active roster system with ~6 PCs, typically 4 per session)
- In-game: Other gladiators whisper about them as a cautionary tale
- Snak is furious about losing an investment
- Their belongings are distributed among survivors (GM discretion)

**Narrative Impact:**
- Stakes are real
- Favor matters
- This death should feel earned (by poor play, solo showboating, or bad luck)
- Party learns: teamwork and crowd engagement are survival tools

## Announcer Beats

[The gates open]

"Enter, champions! Show us how LEGENDS DIE!"
```

```

[Pause—crowd holds breath]

"And now... witness the MIRACLE!"
```

### Resurrection
```
[Golden light fills arena]

"THE PHOENIX SEES! THE PHOENIX JUDGES!"

```

---

## Post-Combat: The Aftermath

Once resurrection is complete and bodies are cleared:

### Immediate Reactions

**The Grand Master addresses the seven:**

> "You have passed through death and emerged STRONGER. The Phoenix has blessed you. Use this gift WISELY."

**Snak meets you in the recovery area, face stormy:**

> "Well. Seven out of eight. Could be worse. Could be better."

[She looks at whoever had lowest Favor's empty bunk]

> "That's on them. And on all of you—should've had each other's backs better."

> "But the scouts were impressed. Three houses want meetings. The temple priestess is _very_ curious. And you've all got a new reputation: Phoenix-Blessed. That's worth coin."

### Favor Rankings and Rewards

Based on final Favor standings (excluding the dead):

**Highest Favor (Top 2):**
- Personal meeting with a noble patron (potential sponsorship)
- 50 gold pieces each
- One uncommon magic item from the armory
- Crowd remembers your name (+1 ongoing Favor for next session)

**Middle Favor (3-5):**
- Meeting with merchant sponsor (potential equipment upgrade)
- 25 gold pieces each  
- One common magic item or superior weapon
- Respect from other gladiators

**Lowest Favor (6-7, but still alive):**
- Standard payment: 10 gold pieces
- Warning from Snak: "Do better next time or you won't get lucky twice"
- Option to train with Kael, Zara, or Fennec to improve

### NPC Reactions

**Kael:** 
> "You survived. Good. Now let's make sure it wasn't luck."  
[Offers tactical training in downtime]

**Zara:**
> "That was GLORIOUS! We died like WARRIORS! Again sometime?"  
[Wants to team up for future bouts]

**Fennec:**
> "Not bad. Few of you understand the crowd better than I thought. Few of you... don't."  
[Offers to teach [[panache|Panache]] optimization]

**Merryn:**
> "I came back with sixteen favor. Just saying."  
[Smug but not unkind—she played the game well]

**Rohm:**
> "You fought with honor. The Phoenix saw truth in you. Thank you."  
[Deep respect, will remember this]

### Between-Session Seeds

- **Temple Priestess Investigation:** She wants to study the resurrection magic. Offers payment for interviews.
- **House Patron Interest:** A noble house wants to sponsor one PC—but demands exclusivity.
- **Merchant Opportunity:** A weapons dealer wants to test new equipment in the arena. Risky but lucrative.
- **Rival Gladiators:** Other fighters are jealous of Phoenix-Blessed status. Tension in the pens.
- **The Dead One's Legacy:** Someone claims to be family of the fallen. Wants answers. Or revenge.
- **Grand Master's Notice:** You're on the radar now. Future bouts will be higher stakes.

---

## Scaling Options

### Too Easy?
- Add +20 HP to Chimera
- Pit Champion arrives one round earlier  
- Reinforcements arrive every round (not every 2 rounds)
- Beast Handlers have better AC (15 instead of 13)

### Too Hard?
- Remove 1 Champion from Stage 1
- Chimera has lower HP (90 instead of 114)
- Pit Champion uses less poison (4d6 instead of 7d6)
- Reinforcements stop arriving after 3 waves

### Someone Not Getting Last Stand?
- Have enemy "toy with them"—knock them down but don't kill
- NPC ally (Kael/Rohm) stabilizes them, urges them to fight on
- Give them opportunity to activate Last Stand next round
- GM fiat: "The crowd DEMANDS your final stand!" (1/combat)

### Favor Gaps Too Wide?
- Award team Favor for major moments (everyone gets +1)
- NPCs deliberately set up PCs for highlight moments
- Grand Master grants bonus Favor mid-combat for specific acts
- Adjust Favor costs on the fly to encourage spending (and re-earning)

---

## Victory Conditions

**Minimum Success:**
- All 8 combatants died
- All 8 triggered Last Stand

- Each PC had memorable Last Stand moment
- Team worked together to spread spotlight

- Party now understands Favor is survival

**This Session's Purpose:**
- Introduce guaranteed death without campaign consequences (mostly)

- Make [[last_stand|Last Stand]] feel epic and powerful
- Show that teamwork and spotlight-sharing matter
- Establish that death is real and permanent for those who don't play the game
- Create reputation: Phoenix-Blessed is a badge of honor
- Set up patron/sponsor system for future sessions
