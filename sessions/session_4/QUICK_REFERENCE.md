# Phoenix Resurrection - Quick Reference

## The Formula

```
Drama Score = (Spent Favor × 2) + Retained Favor
```

## The Rule

**Lowest Drama Score = Permanent Death**

Everyone else resurrects with quality based on their Drama tier.

---

## Resurrection Quality

| Drama Score | Tier | Benefits |
|-------------|------|----------|
| **0-15** | Basic | 1 level exhaustion until next long rest |
| **16-24** | Clean | Full HP, no penalties |
| **25-35** | Vigor | Full HP + Advantage on 1st attack/save next session |
| **36-45** | Blessing | Full HP + Permanent boon (choose one):<br>• +1 skill proficiency<br>• +5 max HP<br>• Phoenix Trinket (1 reroll/long rest) |
| **46+** | Champion | All Blessing benefits + Phoenix Mark + +2 Favor (3 sessions) |

## Calculating Drama Score

### What You Need:
1. **Spent Favor** = Total used during combat
2. **Retained Favor** = Amount remaining at death

### Examples:

**Conservative Player:**
- Earned 18, Spent 4, Retained 14
- Drama = (4 × 2) + 14 = **22** (Clean tier)

**Balanced Player:**
- Earned 22, Spent 12, Retained 10
- Drama = (12 × 2) + 10 = **34** (Vigor tier)

**Aggressive Player:**
- Earned 25, Spent 20, Retained 5
- Drama = (20 × 2) + 5 = **45** (Blessing tier)

**All-In Player:**
- Earned 28, Spent 26, Retained 2
- Drama = (26 × 2) + 2 = **54** (Champion tier!)

---

## Edge Cases

### Tied for Lowest?
1. GM/Patron chooses (dramatic!)
2. Random (roll dice)
3. Both die (harsh)

### Everyone High Drama (25+)?
- Default: Lowest still dies
- Optional: All resurrect if within 3 points and all 30+

### Everyone Low Drama (<15)?
- At least one resurrects (maintain 7/8)
- Others resurrect with penalties
- Snak is VERY disappointed

---

## Optimal Strategy

**Spend 50-75% of earned Favor** for best Drama Score.

Example with 20 Favor earned:
- Spend 0, Keep 20 → Drama = **20**
- Spend 10, Keep 10 → Drama = **30** ✓
- Spend 15, Keep 5 → Drama = **35** ✓✓
- Spend 20, Keep 0 → Drama = **40** ✓✓✓

**More spending is ALWAYS better!**

---

## Why This System?

- Rewards engagement over hoarding
- Values spectacle and risk-taking
- Maintains meaningful stakes
- Encourages teamwork
- Thematically perfect for The Arena

**The Phoenix judges courage and spectacle, not caution.**

---

## GM Reminders During Play

✓ Track BOTH Current Favor AND Spent Favor
✓ Announce Drama Scores every 2-3 rounds
✓ Encourage spending: "You're dying anyway!"
✓ Warn lagging players: "You're at 14 Drama, everyone else is 25+"
✓ Make NPCs model good spending
✓ Narrate crowd reactions to Favor spending

---

## Post-Session Reconstruction

If you forgot to track spent Favor:

1. **Review notes** for Favor abilities used
2. **Ask players** how many times they spent
3. **Estimate based on behavior:**
   - Conservative: 3-6 spent
   - Moderate: 8-14 spent
   - Aggressive: 15-25 spent
   - All-in: 25+ spent

4. **Calculate** Drama for each gladiator
5. **Rank** and determine who stays dead

---

## The Announcement

When revealing results:

> "The Phoenix has judged. It weighs not just courage in death, but spectacle in life. Your Drama Score—earned Favor spent times two, plus what you retained—determines the Phoenix's mercy."

> [Show calculations]

> "Seven shall return. One has fallen short. [Name], your caution has cost you. The Phoenix rewards the bold, not the fearful."
