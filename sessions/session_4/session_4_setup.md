# Session 4 Setup: The *First* Glorious End

## 3 Days Before The Rite

The word spreads through the pens like wildfire: **The Rite of Phoenix Flames**. Veterans go quiet when they hear it. New blood asks questions. Nobody answers directly.

[[merryn|Merryn]] finds you in the common area, her usual smirk replaced by something harder.

> "You hear about the Rite? No? Lucky you—ignorance is bliss."

[She leans against the wall, checking her nails]

> "It's a 'special exhibition.' Means guaranteed resurrection after. Also means guaranteed death _before_. The Grand Master calls it a 'trial of courage.' I call it 'pop your cherry and get over the fear.'"

> "They're putting eight of us in. You lot, me, that stone-faced bastard [[rohm|Rohm]], and three arena rats who know how this works. Message is clear: nobody survives, but everyone comes back. Unless..."

[She pauses, looks you dead in the eye]

> "Unless you've got the _lowest_ favor when it's done. Then the resurrection doesn't take. One person stays dead. Permanently."

> "So die pretty, yeah? The crowd's your insurance policy."

## 2 Days Before The Rite

Three new fighters appear in the pens. Not raw recruits—these are gladiators who've survived, learned the game, understand the sands.

**[[kael_the_blade|Kael "The Blade" Vorsun]]** nods acknowledgment as he enters. Doesn't waste words. Sits down, starts checking his gear with the methodical efficiency of someone who's done this too many times. After a while, he speaks without looking up:

> "Rite of Phoenix. Heard you're in it. Good. Better than fresh meat."

[He tests his shield straps]

> "Three rules: don't die stupid, don't hog the spotlight, don't leave corpses. We all come back except one, and I'm not planning on being the exception. Work together, we all walk away. Showboat solo, someone stays down."

**[[zara_fireheart|Zara Fireheart]]** arrives like a storm—grinning, loud, slapping shoulders. She drops her pack with a heavy thud and immediately starts stretching.

> "FINALLY! A proper death match! Been waiting for this since I got here!"

[She notices the concerned looks]

> "What? You scared? Don't be! We all die, we all come back, and the crowd gets a show they'll talk about for _months_. This is what we're here for! Glory! Battle! The roar of—"

> "—except one of us doesn't come back."

[She pauses mid-stretch, then shrugs]

> "Then we fight like legends and make sure it's not us. Easy."

**[[fennec_quickhand|Fennec Quickhand]]** slips in later, quiet as smoke. She finds a corner, sits cross-legged, and starts juggling three small stones. Eventually, she speaks without stopping the juggling:

> "You all know the trick, right?"

[Nobody answers]

> "The favor thing. Lowest favor stays dead. So here's how this works: we're a team now. Not friends—a team. We spread the glory. You get a good hit, I cheer. I pull off something flashy, you cheer. Crowd sees unity, crowd loves unity. We all bank favor, we all go home."

[She catches all three stones in one hand]

> "Or we fight for spotlight, crowd picks favorites, and someone's family doesn't get a body to bury. Your choice."

## 1 Day Before The Rite

[[rohm|Rohm]] sits with you after the evening meal. His usual stoic silence holds a different weight tonight.

> "The Rite. I know what it is. I've heard stories."

[Long pause]

> "My people believe death in battle honors the fallen. This... this is theater. Controlled death. Purchased resurrection."

[His jaw tightens]

> "But Tovo, Dec, and Lira are safe. They were moved yesterday. Snak kept her word."

[He looks at each of you]

> "I will fight beside you tomorrow. I will protect you as I protected them. And I will earn enough favor to ensure I return—because they need me still."

> "The three who joined us? They understand the Arena. Listen to them. Trust them in combat. We win together or we die alone."

[He stands]

> "Tomorrow, we show them what warriors look like."

## Evening Before The Rite

Snak appears at the cell door. Her face is unreadable.

> "Alright, listen up. This is bigger than your usual bloodbath. The Rite brings nobles, merchants, high-rollers. People who can _buy_ you if you impress them. People who can make you rich if you entertain them. People who can get you _out_ if you're valuable enough."

[She counts on her fingers]

> "Three scouts from major houses. Two merchants looking for 'investments.' And one temple priestess who's _very_ interested in how resurrection magic works when eight people die at once."

[She leans closer]

> "You want my advice? Don't just fight—_perform_. Make them remember your name. Make them ask 'Who was that?' Make them _need_ to sponsor you."

> "And for fuck's sake, don't be the one with lowest favor. I've got money on half of you surviving this figuratively and literally."

## Morning of The Rite

The eight of you gather in the armory. The air is thick with tension.

Kael checks his sword edge. Zara is bouncing on her toes, already pumped. Fennec twirls a dagger absently. Merryn adjusts her mask, face unreadable. Rohm stands like carved stone.

The announcer's voice booms outside, muffled by stone walls.

Kael speaks first:

> "Formation when we enter. Frontline: me, Rohm, Zara. Midline: you fighters. Backline: Merryn, Fennec for range and mobility. Adjust as needed, but start together."

Fennec adds:

> "And spread the favor. Tag team kills. Set each other up. Make it a _show_."

Zara grins:

> "And when [[last_stand|Last Stand]] triggers? Make it _legendary_."

The bugle sounds.

The gates begin to open.

Time to face The Rite of Phoenix Flames.

## Pre-Combat Briefing

**Remind the players:**
- Death is guaranteed and expected
- [[last_stand|Last Stand]] is their heroic moment—use it dramatically
- [[crowds_favor|Crowd's Favor]] is literally life insurance—lowest favor = permanent death
- [[panache|Panache]] rolls matter more than ever
- This is about going out in a blaze of glory, not surviving
- Work together to ensure everyone banks enough favor
- The real victory condition is coming back to life

**Party Composition (8 total):**
- 4-5 Player Characters (level 3)
- [[merryn|Merryn Thal]] (level 3 Rogue/Archer)
- [[rohm|Rohm]] (level 3 Fighter, shield and spear)

- [[zara_fireheart|Zara Fireheart]] (level 3 Barbarian, Berserker)
- [[fennec_quickhand|Fennec Quickhand]] (level 3 Rogue, Thief)
