# Session 4 Setup: The *First* Glorious End

*1 Day Before The Match*

Three new fighters appear in the pens. Not raw recruits—these are gladiators who've survived, learned the game, understand the sands.

*Kael Vorsun* nods acknowledgment as he enters. After a while, he speaks without looking up:

> "Rite of Phoenix. Three rules: don't die stupid, don't hog the spotlight, don't leave corpses. We all come back unless you disappoint, and I'm not planning on being the exception. Work together, we all walk away. Showboat solo, someone stays down."

*Zara Fireheart* arrives like a storm—grinning, loud, slapping shoulders. She drops her pack with a heavy thud and immediately starts stretching.

> "FINALLY! A proper death match! Been waiting for this since I got here! What? You scared? Don't be! We all die, we all come back, and the crowd gets a show they'll talk about for _months_. This is what we're here for! Glory! Battle! The roar of the crowd!

*Fennec* slips in later, quiet as smoke. She finds a corner, sits cross-legged, and starts juggling three small stones. Eventually, she speaks without stopping the juggling:

> "You all know the premise, right? We're a team now. Not friends—a team. We spread the glory. You get a good hit, I cheer. I pull off something flashy, you cheer. Crowd sees unity, crowd loves unity. We all bank favor, we all go home. If you believe them."

*Evening Before The Rite*

Snak appears at the cell door,  face amused and full of anticipation.

> "Alright, listen up meat. Time to pop your cherries. If you've never died before, you're in for a treat. If you *don't* die tonight, you did something horribly wrong. 
> The Rite of the Phoenix Flames: they throw more and more nasties at you till you die. The point isn't to survive: it's to go out big, go out swinging. Every corpse with enough favor will get revived.
>  The Rite is a big deal especially for minnows like you. It brings nobles, merchants, high-rollers. Three scouts from major houses. Two merchants looking for 'investments.' And one temple priestess who's _very_ interested in how resurrection magic works when eight people die at once."
> "Make your name a household chant. Make them ask 'Who was that?' Make them _need_ to sponsor you."
> "And for fuck's sake, don't be the corpse with lowest favor. I've got money on half of you surviving this...  figuratively and literally."
