# Session 4: The *First* Glorious End

**The Rite of Phoenix Flames**

A special exhibition where eight gladiators face impossible odds knowing death is certain—but resurrection awaits. Almost all will rise again. One will not.

## Overview

- **Type:** Guaranteed TPK encounter with resurrection
- **Stakes:** Death is expected. Resurrection is guaranteed. **Except for whoever has the lowest [[phoenix_resurrection_rubric|Drama Score]].**
- **Purpose:** "Pop the death cherry" and teach players that [[crowds_favor|Favor]] usage and showmanship ensure resurrection

## Key Concept

This session introduces the reality of death while minimizing campaign disruption. Everyone knows they'll die—it's about dying *gloriously*. The real competition isn't survival, it's accumulating and **spending** enough [[crowds_favor|Favor]] to maximize your [[phoenix_resurrection_rubric|Drama Score]].

The twist: one person doesn't come back. Permanent death for the gladiator with lowest Drama Score creates real stakes while teaching the importance of teamwork, showmanship, and active crowd engagement. **Spending Favor counts for more than hoarding it.**

## Session Files

- **[Setup](session_4_setup.md)** - Pre-game interactions, NPC introductions, briefing
- **[Encounter](session_4_encounter.md)** - Four escalating combat stages, mechanics, favor tracking
- **[Notes](session_4_notes.md)** - Session log and outcomes (to be filled during play)
- **[Drama Score Tracker](drama_score_tracker.md)** - GM tracking sheet for Favor and Drama calculations

## New Characters

Three arena veterans join the party for this bout:

- **[[kael_the_blade|Kael "The Blade" Vorsun]]** - Level 3 Fighter (Battle Master), tactical and protective
- **[[zara_fireheart|Zara Fireheart]]** - Level 3 Barbarian (Berserker), aggressive and fearless
- **[[fennec_quickhand|Fennec Quickhand]]** - Level 3 Rogue (Thief), mobile and opportunistic

These NPCs understand the Arena, know how [[crowds_favor|Crowd's Favor]] works, and will teach PCs through example.

## GM Preparation Notes

- **Track Drama Score:** Use the [Drama Score Tracker](drama_score_tracker.md) to track both Current Favor AND Spent Favor
- **Announce Drama regularly:** Players need to know their standings to make informed decisions
- **Encourage spending:** Spending Favor is worth 2× hoarding in resurrection calculations
- Pace enemy waves to allow all PCs opportunity for [[last_stand|Last Stand]]
- Emphasize teamwork and favor-sharing in pre-combat briefing
- Make each death dramatic and give it spotlight
- The permanent death should feel like consequence of choices (hoarding vs. spending), not random chance
- Have backup character options ready for affected player
- Prepare patron/sponsor NPCs for aftermath meetings
