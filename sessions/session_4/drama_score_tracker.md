# Drama Score Tracker - Session 4

**Quick Reference:** Drama Score = (Spent Favor × 2) + Retained Favor

**Terminology Note:** "Retained Favor" is the Favor remaining at death (also called "Final Favor" or "Current Favor at death").

Use this sheet to track both current and spent Favor throughout combat.

## How to Track

### When Favor is Gained
1. Add to "Current Favor" column
2. Announce: "That's +2 Favor for Zara! She's at 8 current, 4 spent, 20 Drama total!"

### When Favor is Spent
1. Subtract from "Current Favor"
2. Add to "Spent Favor"
3. Recalculate Drama Score
4. Announce: "Kael spends 3 Favor on Crowd Shield! That's 15 spent total, 5 retained, 35 Drama!"

### Drama Score Calculation
```
Drama = (Spent × 2) + Current
```

Example: If Zara has 6 Current and has Spent 12 total:
```
Drama = (12 × 2) + 6 = 24 + 6 = 30
```

## Milestone Announcements

Announce Drama Scores at key moments:
- **Round 3:** "Let's check Drama Scores so far..."
- **Round 5:** "Halfway through—who's creating the most spectacle?"
- **Round 7:** "Time is running out! Your Drama Score determines resurrection!"
- **Last Death:** "Final Drama Scores being calculated..."

## Warning System

If someone is significantly behind (5+ Drama below next-lowest), warn them:
- Subtle: "The crowd seems less invested in [Name]'s performance..."
- Direct: "[Name], you're at 12 Drama—everyone else is 18+!"
- Urgent: "Spend your Favor! You're dying anyway—make it COUNT!"

## Post-Combat Calculations

### Final Drama Scores

| Rank | Gladiator | Drama Score | Resurrection Tier |
|------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| 1st  |           |             |                   |
| 2nd  |           |             |                   |
| 3rd  |           |             |                   |
| 4th  |           |             |                   |
| 5th  |           |             |                   |
| 6th  |           |             |                   |
| 7th  |           |             |                   |
| 8th  |           | **DEAD**    | No resurrection   |

### Resurrection Quality Reference

- **0-15 Drama:** Basic (1 exhaustion)
- **16-24 Drama:** Clean (full HP)
- **25-35 Drama:** Vigor (advantage next session)
- **36-45 Drama:** Blessing (permanent boon)
- **46+ Drama:** Champion (Phoenix Mark, +2 Favor)

## Example Scenarios

### Good Spending Pattern
**Round 3:** Current 8, Spent 6 → Drama 20
**Round 5:** Current 4, Spent 14 → Drama 32
**Round 7:** Current 2, Spent 18 → Drama 38
**Final:** Current 0, Spent 22 → Drama 44 (Phoenix Blessing tier!)

### Dangerous Hoarding
**Round 3:** Current 9, Spent 1 → Drama 11
**Round 5:** Current 14, Spent 2 → Drama 18
**Round 7:** Current 16, Spent 3 → Drama 22
**Final:** Current 18, Spent 4 → Drama 26 (Good score, but risky if others spent more)

## GM Reminders

✓ Track BOTH columns—spent is worth 2× retained!
✓ Announce Drama Scores regularly—players need to know standings
✓ Encourage spending—"You're dying anyway, make them REMEMBER you!"
✓ Warn laggards around Round 5-6
✓ Have NPCs model good spending behavior
✓ Narrate crowd reactions to spending: "The crowd ROARS as Kael activates Crowd Shield!"
✓ Final Drama determines both WHO resurrects and QUALITY of resurrection
