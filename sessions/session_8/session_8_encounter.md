# Session 8 Encounter: The Burden Relay

## Ancient Gladiatorial Tradition

**Party:** 5 PCs, level 4
**Objective:** Carry the Obelisk Shard 120 feet from West Gate to East Gate while defending against continuous enemy waves. Two PCs must carry at all times; carriers cannot fight. Swap carriers every 3 rounds to avoid exhaustion. If the Shard is dropped or destroyed, the relay fails.
**Expected Outcome:** High-intensity cooperative combat where timing, coordination, and trust determine survival. Multiple knockdowns expected, potential for 1 PC death if poor tactics.

---

## Arena Layout

The arena has been reconfigured into a **120-foot-long gauntlet** (20 feet wide) running from West Gate to East Gate. Unlike the usual circular battlefield, this is a narrow corridor designed to force linear progression.

### Physical Dimensions
- **Total Length:** 120 feet (West Gate to East Gate)
- **Width:** 20 feet (consistent throughout)
- **Height:** Arena walls are 20 feet tall on both long sides
- **Side Tunnels:** 8 small tunnel gates (10 feet × 10 feet each) along both sides for enemy spawns
  - 4 tunnels on north side (at 20, 40, 80, 100 feet from West Gate)
  - 4 tunnels on south side (at 30, 60, 90, 110 feet from West Gate)
- **Gates:** West Gate (entrance) and East Gate (goal) are both 15 feet wide, 15 feet tall

### Starting Grounds Zone (0-40 feet from West Gate)

**Terrain Features:**
- Packed dirt floor, relatively flat and open
- 6 wooden barricades scattered throughout zone:
  - 2 barricades at 10 feet (north and south sides)
  - 3 barricades at 25 feet (north, center, south)
  - 1 barricade at 35 feet (center)
- Each barricade is 5 feet wide, 4 feet tall, provides half-cover (+2 AC, +2 Dex saves)
- Barricades create difficult terrain (costs extra 5 feet to move through their space)
- Can be destroyed: AC 15, 20 HP (for Panache plays)

**Sightlines:**
- Clear visibility throughout zone
- Side tunnels visible and closed initially
- Can see into Killing Field zone (next 40 feet)

**Tactical Summary:**
- Easiest zone to navigate
- Barricades offer cover for defenders but slow carrier progress
- Good area to establish carrier rhythm and test first swap

### Killing Field Zone (40-80 feet from West Gate)

**Terrain Features:**
- Entire zone is **difficult terrain** (swirling sand and debris)
- Carriers move only 10 feet per round here (15-foot speed halved by difficult terrain)
- **Disadvantage on all Perception checks** (sand obscures vision)

**Spike Pits (2 total):**
- **Pit #1:** Located at 50 feet from West Gate, centered (10 × 10 feet)
- **Pit #2:** Located at 65 feet from West Gate, offset south (10 × 10 feet)
- **DC 13 Perception to spot** (active or passive)
- **DC 13 Dexterity save to avoid** (if moving into pit)
- **Damage:** 2d6 piercing + restrained condition
- **Restrained:** Speed 0, disadvantage on attacks, advantage on attacks against victim
- **Escape:** DC 13 Athletics or Acrobatics check (action)
- Pits are 10 feet deep with wooden spikes at bottom
- Can be used tactically (shove enemies into pits for +2 Favor)

**Elevated Archer Platforms (2 total):**
- **Platform #1:** North side at 55 feet, 15 feet high, 10 × 10 feet
- **Platform #2:** South side at 70 feet, 15 feet high, 10 × 10 feet
- Archers (Scouts) spawn here Round 2
- **+2 to hit vs slow-moving carriers** (advantage from height + size)
- **Disadvantage to hit fast-moving defenders**
- Platforms can be climbed (DC 13 Athletics) to neutralize archers
- No railings—can be shoved off (10-foot fall, 1d6 damage)

**Sightlines:**
- Reduced visibility due to swirling sand
- Enemies harder to spot before they close to melee
- Archer platforms provide clear firing lanes down length of zone

**Tactical Summary:**
- Most dangerous zone in gauntlet
- Difficult terrain slows carrier progress significantly
- Spike pits threaten carriers and defenders alike
- Archers create constant ranged pressure on carriers
- Poor visibility enables enemy ambushes
- Defenders must scout ahead and clear threats before carriers arrive

### Final Stretch Zone (80-120 feet from West Gate)

**Terrain Features:**
- Series of unstable wooden platforms replacing solid ground
- Each platform is 10 feet × 20 feet (spans full width)
- Platforms at 80-90 feet, 90-100 feet, 100-110 feet, 110-120 feet
- Platforms creak, sway, and threaten to collapse under weight

**Collapsing Platform Mechanic:**
- Every 10 feet traveled: **DC 12 Athletics check** (per carrier)
- **Both carriers must check together**—if one fails, both are affected
- **Failure:** Platform collapses, 10-foot fall, 1d6 bludgeoning damage
- Failed check doesn't stop forward progress—just deals damage
- Defenders can "test" platforms ahead (make checks before carriers arrive)
- Destroyed platforms create 10-foot gaps (Athletics DC 10 to jump)

**East Gate (Locked):**
- Heavy iron gate at 120-foot mark (goal line)
- 15 feet wide, 15 feet tall, solid iron construction
- **Locked with heavy iron chains and padlock**
- **DC 13 Thieves' Tools check** (action) to pick lock, OR
- **DC 15 Athletics check** (action) to force gate open with brute strength
- **Alternative:** Destroy gate (AC 19, 30 HP) with attacks
- Gate must be opened before Shard can cross—carriers must wait while defender unlocks

**Goblin Ambush:**
- 4 Goblins hiding in rafters above zone (20 feet high)
- Drop when carriers cross 80-foot threshold
- **DC 12 Perception to spot** before ambush (disadvantage due to looking up while navigating)
- If undetected: Goblins get surprise round
- Goblins attack from above, then scatter using Nimble Escape

**Ceiling Rafters:**
- 20 feet high throughout zone
- Wooden beams crisscrossing
- Can be climbed (DC 13 Athletics) to pursue Goblins
- No mechanical benefit otherwise

**Sightlines:**
- Clear visibility to East Gate from 80 feet onward
- Can see goal, builds tension and urgency
- Rafters partially obscure ceiling (Goblin hiding spots)

**Tactical Summary:**
- Final obstacle before victory
- Platforms are unavoidable danger—damage likely
- East Gate lock creates final decision point (who breaks formation to unlock?)
- Goblin ambush adds chaos at worst possible moment
- Final 20 feet from gate to goal are sprint to victory—all-out push needed
- Visible goal creates emotional climax—so close yet so far

## The Obelisk Shard (Core Mechanic)

### Physical Description
- Massive crystal fragment, 6 feet tall, 3 feet wide at base, tapering to point
- Translucent with inner glow (pulsing light, color shifts from blue to white)
- Covered in ancient runes (Arcana DC 15: fragment of Titan's Prison obelisk)
- Weighs approximately 800 pounds (impossibly heavy for one person)
- Surface is smooth but not slippery—good grip needed

### Carrying Requirements
- **Exactly 2 PCs required simultaneously** (no more, no less)
- Both carriers use both hands (cannot wield weapons, shields, or items)
- **Cannot make weapon attacks** while carrying
- **Cannot cast spells** requiring somatic (hand) components
- **Cannot use items** (potions, scrolls, wands, etc.)
- **CAN make Strength (Athletics) checks** (break grapples, shove enemies)
- **CAN take Dodge action** (only defensive option)
- **CAN make saving throws** normally

### Movement Rules
- Carriers move together (coordinate on same initiative or declare joint movement)
- **Base movement speed: 15 feet per round** (both must agree on path)
- Difficult terrain affects them (Killing Field reduces to 10 feet/round)
- Must stay within 5 feet of each other or Shard becomes unstable (warning)
- If separated more than 10 feet: Shard drops automatically

### Exhaustion Mechanics (Critical Timer)
- Every 3 rounds of carrying: **DC 14 Constitution save** (both carriers roll)
- **First Failure:** Gain 1 exhaustion level (disadvantage on ability checks)
- **Second Failure (6 rounds total):** Auto-drop Shard + take 1d6 damage from strain
- **Solution:** Swap carriers every 3 rounds with fresh PCs to avoid exhaustion

**Exhaustion Effects Reminder:**
- Level 1: Disadvantage on ability checks (Athletics, Acrobatics, etc.)
- Level 2: Speed halved (carriers drop to 7-foot speed—devastating)
- Level 3: Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws

### Shard Vulnerability
- **AC 18** (crystal is tough but not indestructible)
- **50 HP total** (track publicly—PCs and players should know Shard HP)
- Resistant to non-magical damage (but most enemies use mundane weapons—no effect)
- **If dropped during swap:** Cracks audibly, enemies immediately gain advantage on attacks vs Shard for 1 round, and 1d4 additional enemies spawn at count 15 (reinforcements)
- **If dropped in enemy threatened square:** Enemies attack it immediately as reactions
- **If reduced to 0 HP:** Shard shatters—instant defeat, no rewards, session ends

### Shard Properties
- Glows brighter as it approaches East Gate (cosmetic, builds tension)
- Radiates faint abjuration magic (Detect Magic reveals)
- Cannot be stored in bags of holding, teleported, or moved by magic
- **Must be physically carried by two creatures**
- If touched by creature not currently carrying: mild magical feedback (1 point lightning, harmless)

---

## Swap Mechanics (Critical Cooperation)

### When to Swap
- **Recommended: Every 3 rounds** before exhaustion kicks in
- Tactical decision: Swap early for safety vs. swap late to maintain progress
- Track carrier rounds openly: "Round 1 for current carriers... Round 2... Round 3—SWAP NOW!"

### Swap Process (Step-by-Step)
1. **Spatial Requirement:** All 5 PCs must be within 10 feet of Shard
2. **Old Carriers:** Use their action to carefully release Shard (cannot attack)
3. **New Carriers:** Use their action to lift and stabilize Shard (cannot attack)
4. **Full Round Committed:** Both old and new carriers are occupied this round
5. **Defenders' Role:** Create "swap window"—clear 10-foot radius of enemies
6. **Completion:** At end of round, new carriers have control, old carriers are free to act normally next round

### Swap Window (Defensive Perimeter)
- **Goal:** Clear 10-foot radius around Shard of all enemies
- Defenders use their turns before swap to push enemies back:
  - Shove actions (contested Athletics)
  - Damaging attacks to force retreat
  - Crowd control spells (*thunderwave*, *gust of wind*, etc.)
- **If swap window is NOT clear:** Enemies get opportunity attacks during swap

### Tactical Considerations
- **Announce swaps early:** "We're swapping on initiative count 15—cover us!"
- **Coordinate timing:** Have new carriers move into position before swap begins
- **Enemy readied actions:** Enemies will ready attacks for when swap begins if able
- **Swap under fire:** If forced to swap in combat without clear window, expect to take damage

### Failed Swap Scenarios

**Only 1 PC tries to carry:**
- Auto-failure, Shard drops to ground
- Loud crack, Shard takes 5 damage
- Combat pauses for 1 round while PCs scramble to re-lift (all PCs lose next turn)
- Enemy reinforcements spawn (1d4 additional enemies at count 15)

**Swapping in threatened space (enemy within 5 feet):**
- Enemy gets opportunity attack vs carriers during swap
- If carrier takes damage during swap: DC 15 Strength save or drop Shard
- Risk of dropping Shard and triggering reinforcements

**Not all PCs within 10 feet:**
- Swap cannot complete
- Old carriers must continue carrying or drop Shard
- Waste actions attempting swap

### Successful Swap Rewards
- Describe cinematically: smooth handoff, trust, teamwork
- Old carriers get brief respite (become defenders)
- New carriers feel full weight, strain begins fresh
- **Crowd Favor:** +1 to all PCs if swap executed with no damage taken during handoff

---

## Enemy Tactics by Priority

### Priority 1: Destroy the Shard
- If adjacent to Shard and no PC blocks path: attack Shard (AC 18)
- Deal weapon damage directly to Shard's 50 HP
- Veterans (1d8+3) and Berserkers (1d12+3) most dangerous to Shard
- Announce: "The Veteran swings at the CRYSTAL! That's 11 damage to Shard!"

### Priority 2: Grapple/Restrain Carriers
- Bandits, Thugs attempt grapples:
  - Contested Athletics check (enemy +2 to +4 depending on type)
  - If successful: Carrier is grappled (speed 0)
  - Other carrier cannot move Shard alone—progress halts
  - Must break grapple or have defender shove enemy off
- Drag grappled carrier away from partner (separate >10 feet = drop Shard)

### Priority 3: Kill/Disable Defenders
- Remove defenders to leave carriers vulnerable
- Priest uses *hold person* (DC 13 Wis save) to paralyze defenders
- Assassin uses poison to one-shot defenders if possible
- Focus fire on wounded defenders (finish them off)

### Priority 4: Readied Actions During Swaps
- Enemies within 30 feet of Shard ready attacks when swap begins
- "I attack the carrier when they start swapping!"
- Punish poor swap timing or lack of swap window
- Deal damage during swap to potentially cause Shard drop (DC 15 Str save if damaged)

### Enemy Communication
- Bandits/Thugs shout: "Break the crystal!" "Grapple them!" "Attack during swap!"
- Veterans coordinate: "Focus fire on the Shard!" "Hold them in place!"
- Priest chants spells ominously
- Assassin is silent, professional
- Goblins cackle and shriek chaotically

---

## GM Tips

### Tracking Systems
- **Round counter:** Visible to all (critical for swap timing)
- **Carrier rotation tracker:** "Current carriers: [PC1] and [PC2], Round 2 of 3"
- **Shard HP:** Track publicly—announce every hit to Shard
- **Progress marker:** Mark 0, 40, 80, 120 feet on map clearly
- **Zone transitions:** Announce when entering new zone dramatically

### Narration Focus
- **Carrier helplessness:** "Your arms tremble under the weight. You see the Bandit charging, but you can't defend yourself—your hands are full."
- **Swap vulnerability:** Describe in slow motion—"The old carriers carefully release. The crystal tilts. The new carriers strain to catch it. You're all vulnerable. The enemy readies..."
- **Shard damage:** Make it visceral—"The blade bites into crystal! A crack spiderwebs across its surface! Shard HP: 38!"
- **Enemy spawns:** Dramatic reveals—"The tunnel gates SLAM open! More warriors pour forth!"

### Pacing
- Use physical round timer (builds urgency)
- Skip trivial movement ("You advance 15 feet, now at 45 feet total")
- Slow down swaps (make them cinematic)
- Speed up enemy turns (keep focus on PCs)
- Announce milestones ("You've crossed into Killing Field!" "60 feet! Halfway there!")

### Player Communication
- Encourage pre-swap planning: "Swap happening in 2 rounds—start positioning now"
- Reward creative coordination: "You want to time your *thunderwave* right before the swap? Great!"
- Allow signal systems: "You work out hand signals for 'swap now'? Perfect."
- Remind exhaustion timing: "That's 3 rounds carrying—make your Con saves or swap"

### Difficulty Adjustment (Mid-Session)
- **If PCs struggling:** Reduce enemy spawn count (1-2 fewer per wave)
- **If PCs dominating:** Add extra Veteran to Round 5 wave
- **If Shard nearly destroyed:** Narrator intervention ("The crystal's magic hardens briefly!")
- **If perfect execution:** Add challenge ("The Grand Master sends elite guards!")

### Emotional Beats
- Celebrate swaps: "Perfect handoff! The crowd ROARS!"
- Mourn failures: "The crystal cracks. The crowd GASPS."
- Build tension at checkpoints: "40 feet done. 80 to go. The hardest part awaits."
- Create relief at respites: "Round 4—no new enemies. Catch your breath."

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Don't forget carrier exhaustion saves (track meticulously)
- Don't skip enemy spawn rounds (pressure must be constant)
- Don't make Shard invulnerable (it's a real threat)
- Don't rush swaps (they're dramatic moments)
- Don't ignore environment (spike pits, platforms matter)

---

## Scaling Options

### For 5 Level 4 PCs (Baseline)
- Enemies as listed in spawn schedule
- Shard: 50 HP, AC 18
- Exhaustion: DC 14 Con saves every 3 rounds
- Difficulty: Hard (resource drain, 1 death possible)

### If Too Easy (PCs Dominating)
- Increase Assassin HP to 100 (CR 8 full power)
- Add 1 Veteran to Round 3 spawn
- Reduce respite (spawn 2 Thugs in Round 4)
- Berserkers spawn starting Round 5 (earlier pressure)
- Increase spike pit DC to 14
- Increase platform collapse DC to 13

### If Too Hard (PCs Struggling)
- Reduce Assassin to CR 5 stats (HP 50, poison 12 damage)
- Remove Priest from Round 3 (just 2 Veterans)
- Increase Shard HP to 75
- Allow 4-round carry before first Con save
- Reduce spike pit damage to 1d6
- Provide Shard AC 16 instead of 18

### If PCs Perfectly Coordinated (Easy Mode)
- Round 6 reinforcement: 2 Veterans + 1 Priest enter together
- Announcer: "The defenders are TOO STRONG! The Grand Master sends REINFORCEMENTS!"
- Archers use special attacks (impose disadvantage on next action if hit)
- East Gate lock DC increases to 15 (Thieves' Tools) or 17 (Athletics)

### If PCs Falling Apart (Hard Mode Gone Wrong)
- Reduce enemy spawn count by 1-2 per wave
- Narrator hint: "The crowd throws a healing potion!" (1 free use)
- Snak shouts tactical advice from stands: "Create swap window! Push them back!"
- Mysteriously fewer enemies Round 8 (crowd interference)
- Increase Shard HP mid-combat (crowd magic?)
