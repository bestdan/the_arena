# Session 8: The Burden Shared

An ancient gladiatorial tradition returns—four champions must carry the Burden Stone across 210 feet of deadly gauntlet while enemies swarm. The Shard is impossibly heavy; only two can bear it at once, and they cannot fight while carrying. With only 2 defenders at any time, coordination and timing determine survival. Everyone carries. Everyone fights.
