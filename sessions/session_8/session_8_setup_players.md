# Session 8 Setup: The Burden Shared

### 3 Days After Session 7

You've proven yourselves time and again—survived fire, shadow, hunts, and chaos. The crowd knows your names.

[[../../npcs/Snak|Snak]] arrives with a knowing look, carrying an old scroll case.

> "Alright, champions. You've built a reputation. The Grand Master wants to test something different this time—not just your ability to kill, but your ability to work as one."

She unrolls an ancient parchment showing a long corridor with obstacles.

> "Ever heard of the Burden Shared? No? It's an old tradition—centuries old. Used to test gladiator cohorts before they'd fight as units. Here's the simple version: You carry something impossibly heavy from one end of the arena to the other. While enemies try to stop you."

She taps the scroll.

> "The Burden Stone. Ancient crystal, weighs more than any one person can lift. Takes TWO of you to carry it—both hands, total commitment. The carriers can't fight. Can't cast. Can't defend themselves. They just carry."

Her expression grows serious.

> "The other two? Your job is to keep them alive. With only four of you, there's no bench—half your team is always carrying, half is always defending. Everyone will carry eventually. Everyone will defend eventually."

> "Enemies will enter continuously from side tunnels. They want to break the Shard, kill the carriers, stop your progress. And here's the catch—carriers can only hold it for about 15 seconds before exhaustion sets in. Then you HAVE to swap. Fresh carriers take over, exhausted ones defend. It's a relay."

She points to marked zones on the map.

> "From West Gate to East Gate. 210 feet of death. Three zones: Starting Grounds, Killing Field, and Final Stretch. Each has its own hazards—spike pits, collapsing platforms, locked gates. No safe zones. Just keep moving, keep swapping, keep fighting."

> "This one's about trust, timing, and communication. Drop the Burden during a swap? Enemies swarm. Fail to swap before exhaustion? Carriers collapse. Let enemies reach the Burden? They'll attack it directly—it can break."

She rolls up the scroll.

> "Intel costs the usual. 50 for the full tactical breakdown. Your call. But I'll say this—with only four of you, coordination matters more than ever. Talk to each other. Plan your swaps. Protect your carriers. Everyone must pull their weight."

### The Night Before the Match

If you paid for intel, Snak returns with detailed notes.

> "Right. Burden Shared tactical breakdown."

> "The Burden Stone requires exactly two carriers. Both use both hands. Can't attack, can't cast spells with hand motions, can't use items. Movement speed drops to 15 feet—you coordinate as a pair. If only one tries to carry? Auto-failure. Shard drops. Everyone scrambles for a full round to lift it again."

She flips through her notes.

> "Exhaustion timer is non-negotiable. Every three rounds, carriers make a Constitution save—DC 14. Fail once, you gain exhaustion—disadvantage on everything. Fail twice, you drop the Shard and take damage. The solution? Swap carriers every three rounds. Fresh PCs take over before exhaustion kicks in. With only four of you, that means everyone carries eventually."

> "The arena is 210 feet long, 20 feet wide. West Gate to East Gate. Three zones:"

> "**Starting Grounds** (0-70 feet): Barricades provide half-cover but slow you down. Relatively safe. Enemies probe your defenses here. Good zone to establish your rhythm."

> "**Killing Field** (70-140 feet): Three spike pits—10-foot squares, DC 13 Dexterity or you take 2d6 and get restrained. Enemy archers on elevated positions—15 feet high, +2 to hit carriers. Swirling sand everywhere—difficult terrain, disadvantage on Perception. This zone will slow you to 10 feet per round."

> "**Final Stretch** (140-210 feet): Collapsing platforms. Carriers make DC 12 Athletics every 10 feet or fall for 1d6 damage. That's seven platform checks. East Gate is locked—someone needs Thieves' Tools DC 13 or Athletics DC 15 to force it. Three goblins drop from the ceiling when you enter."

She taps a warning note.

> "Enemies spawn throughout the relay. Starts simple—bandits and thugs. Escalates to a veteran, a priest, then a gladiator. They'll target the Shard directly. For four of you at level 4, expect about 15 enemies total throughout the relay. It'll take 14-16 rounds if you're efficient."

> "Enemy priorities are clear: First, attack the Shard directly—if they break it, you lose instantly. Second, grapple or restrain carriers—slow your progress. Third, kill defenders—leave carriers vulnerable. They'll ready actions to attack during your swaps. Time those swaps carefully."

> "Swapping mechanics: Takes a full round. All of you need to be within 10 feet of the Shard. Both old and new carriers use their action to transfer—can't attack that round. Defenders must clear a 10-foot radius so the swap is safe. Announce swaps clearly—give yourselves time to set up."

She looks at each of you.

> "Strategy: Decide carrier rotations now. With four of you, it's simple: two carry, two defend, then swap. Who goes first, second, third? Stick to the plan. Defenders create 'swap windows'—push enemies back before swaps. Track rounds openly—everyone knows when the next swap is coming. Use the environment—shove enemies into spike pits, use barricades for cover. Focus fire on enemies threatening the Shard."

> "If the Shard gets damaged—it has 50 HP, AC 18—enemies WILL attack it. If it drops to 0, it shatters. You fail. Also, if you drop it during a swap? Loud crack. Reinforcements arrive immediately."

She closes her notes.

> "This isn't about individual glory. It's about the team functioning as one organism. Carriers trust defenders. Defenders protect carriers. Everyone communicates. With only four of you, there's no margin for error—when you swap, all four of you are occupied that round. No one can defend during the swap. Plan accordingly."

> "You do this right, the crowd will remember it for months. You do it wrong, the Shard breaks and you walk away with nothing."

> "Want gear? Shop's open. And get a signal system worked out—hand signs, code words, something. When things get chaotic around Round 9 or 10, you won't have time for debate."

### As You Walk Into the Arena

The gates open to reveal a long, narrow gauntlet. The arena has been reconfigured—instead of the usual circular battleground, you see a 210-foot corridor stretching from the West Gate where you stand to the distant East Gate, barely visible through the haze.

Near your feet rests the Obelisk Shard—a massive crystal fragment, roughly six feet tall and glowing with inner light. Even from a few feet away, you can feel its impossible weight.

Barricades are scattered in the first zone, darker patches hint at spike pits in the middle distance, and far ahead, you can barely make out precarious platforms swaying slightly. It's a long way to the goal.

The announcer's voice booms across the arena:

```
"CITIZENS OF TARSUS! Today we revive an ANCIENT TRADITION!"

[The crowd roars with anticipation]

"THE Burden Shared! FOUR gladiators! One sacred crystal! 210 feet of DEATH!"

[Dramatic pause as a massive crystal is wheeled to the starting position]

"Behold the Obelisk Shard—fragment of the Titan's Prison! Too heavy for one! Too precious to drop! Two must CARRY while two DEFEND! Everyone carries! Everyone fights!"

[Side tunnel gates rattle—enemies are waiting]

"But they are NOT alone! Warriors spawn from the depths! Archers take their posts! Elite fighters await in shadow! The crystal WILL be attacked! The carriers WILL be hunted!"

[The crowd's roar intensifies]

"Three rounds to carry! Then SWAP or COLLAPSE! Drop the crystal and reinforcements SWARM! Break the crystal and GLORY is LOST!"

[Drums begin pounding—a rhythmic countdown]

"210 feet! 20 feet wide! Three zones of chaos! No safe harbor! Only TEAMWORK survives! Only UNITY conquers!"

[The West Gate slams shut behind you—there's no turning back]

"Who will carry first? Who will defend? Who will TRUST their comrades when death closes in?!"

[The first enemy war cry echoes from the eastern tunnels]

"Let the Burden Shared BEGIN!"

[Horn blast. Initiative is rolled.]
```

The crystal glows brighter. The first enemies emerge from side tunnels. The relay begins.
