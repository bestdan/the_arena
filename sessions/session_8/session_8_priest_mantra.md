"Flesh lies. Iron speaks truth.
You are weak—the hilt does not lie about this.
You are breakable—the stone does not pretend otherwise.
In the soft world, you hide behind words, behind comfort, behind excuses.
Here, under the weight, there is only what you can bear and what crushes you.

The burden does not care for your fear.
The burden does not listen to your doubt.
Pick it up. Feel your weakness scream.
Let the weight burn the soft parts away.

Straight back. Locked grip. No mercy.
Your body will break or it will become iron.
The weight decides. The weight is truth.
Bear it. Become worthy of the burden.

These words are wind. The bar is scripture.
Lift."
