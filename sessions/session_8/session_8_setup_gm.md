# Session 8 GM Setup: The Burden Shared

## Pre-Session Checklist

**Party Composition:**
- 4 PCs, level 4
- Expected: Mix of melee and ranged, at least one spellcaster
- Check for: Healing abilities, crowd control, mobility features
- Key: Communication and coordination matter more than damage
- **Critical:** With only 2 defenders at any time, every PC must be versatile

**Mechanics to Review:**
- [[../../mechanics/crowds_favor|Crowd Favor]] system
- [[../../mechanics/panache|Panache]] for creative plays
- Grapple rules (enemies will use these heavily)
- Exhaustion conditions (critical mechanic)
- Object AC and HP (Shard can be attacked)
- Restrained condition (spike pits)
- Athletics/Acrobatics contests

**Key Resources:**
- Round counter (track publicly—essential for swap timing)
- Initiative tracker with enemy spawn at count 15
- Carrier rotation tracker (who's carrying, how many rounds)
- Constitution save tracker (for carrier exhaustion)
- Shard HP tracker (50 HP, AC 18—public)
- Progress tracker (mark 0, 40, 80, 120 feet clearly)
- Zone map with hazards marked
- Enemy spawn schedule (rounds 1-9+)
- Index cards for "swap windows" (10-foot radius clear zones)

**Session Goal:**
- High-tension cooperative combat emphasizing teamwork
- Reward strategic planning (swap timing, defender positioning)
- Create memorable moments (clutch swaps, Shard saves, carrier heroics)
- Showcase helplessness of carriers (they trust defenders completely)
- Make swaps feel dramatic—the most vulnerable moments

## Roleplaying Hooks

### Snak's Pre-Session Briefing
Snak should emphasize four critical points:
1. **Two carriers always**—one person can't carry alone, coordination is mandatory
2. **Swap every 3 rounds**—exhaustion will kill you if you don't rotate
3. **Everyone carries eventually**—with only 4 of you, all must take turns
4. **Communication is survival**—plan swaps, call out threats, work as unit

Tone: Serious but encouraging. This tests them as a team, not as individuals. She respects their growth and wants them to succeed. She should emphasize that with 4 PCs, there's no bench—everyone is always engaged.

### Announcer Characterization
The announcer should emphasize the ancient tradition aspect—this is a legendary test of unity, not just a spectacle. Tone: Reverent at start, excited during action, awed at swaps.

**Key Announcer Beats:**
- Opening: "ANCIENT TRADITION returns!"
- First swap: "The EXCHANGE! Smooth as silk!"
- Enemy targets Shard: "They strike the CRYSTAL! PROTECT the relic!"
- Exhaustion failure: "Strain takes its TOLL! Can they recover?!"
- Killing Field entry: "Into the gauntlet's HEART!"
- Final Stretch: "The gate is IN SIGHT! One last PUSH!"
- Victory: "THE SHARD CROSSES! Unity conquers adversity!"

### Enemy Communication
Most enemies are hired thugs—they shout tactical calls:
- "Break the crystal!"
- "Grapple the carriers!"
- "Attack during the swap!"
- Veterans and the Assassin are more professional, less vocal

---

## Combat Flow Suggestions

### Pre-Combat (Round 0)
- PCs enter arena, see the gauntlet layout
- Burden Stone at West Gate (describe its weight, glow)
- Enemies visible through side tunnel grates
- Announcer delivers opening speech
- **Give PCs 1 minute to plan**—Who carries first? Swap signals? Defender positions?
- Roll initiative; note enemy spawn at count 15 each round

**GM Focus:**
- Set the scene: long corridor, distant East Gate, oppressive weight of Shard
- Emphasize: "This is about working together. Plan now."
- Answer questions about Shard mechanics, swap process
- Make sure they understand: carriers are helpless, defenders are everything

### Starting Grounds (Rounds 1-5, 0-70 feet)

**Round 1:**
- First two PCs lift Shard (describe strain, coordination needed)
- Movement begins: 15 feet per round (shared speed)
- **At count 15: 3 Bandits spawn** from side tunnels (CR 1/8 each)
- Bandits rush toward Shard
- Only 2 defenders to engage—must be efficient

**Round 2:**
- Carriers advance another 15 feet (total: 30 feet)
- Barricades provide cover but slow movement
- **At count 15: 2 Thugs spawn** (CR 1/2 each)
- Thugs use Pack Tactics—dangerous if they flank
- 2 defenders must control spacing

**Round 3:**
- Carriers advance another 15 feet (total: 45 feet)
- **SWAP WARNING**: If using same carriers, DC 14 Con save at start of Round 4
- Announce: "Carriers have been holding for 3 rounds—swap now or risk exhaustion!"
- **At count 15: 2 Scouts spawn** (CR 1/2 each) on elevated platforms ahead
- Scouts position at 90 and 115 feet, will harass with arrows
- PCs should be planning/executing first swap

**Round 4:**
- **No spawns** (respite for swap)
- Ideal swap round
- Carriers at ~60 feet

**Round 5:**
- Carriers entering Killing Field (~70 feet, difficult terrain begins)
- **At count 15: 1 Veteran spawns** (CR 3—major threat)
- Defenders must prioritize Veteran before it reaches Shard

**GM Focus:**
- Track rounds openly: "Round 1 of 3 for current carriers"
- Narrate carrier strain: "Arms trembling, sweat pouring, crystal HEAVY"
- Bandits should threaten Shard—describe attacks on crystal vividly
- Barricades slow movement but provide tactical options (half-cover)
- With only 2 defenders, emphasize how stretched thin they are
- Build tension toward first swap

### Killing Field (Rounds 5-10, 70-140 feet)

**Already covered in Starting Grounds above—Round 4 is respite**

**Round 6:**
- Carriers at ~80 feet, deep in Killing Field
- Spike pits become active threats (DC 13 Perception, DC 13 Dex save)
- **At count 15: 1 Priest spawns** (CR 2)
- Priest targets defenders with *hold person* (DC 13 Wis save)
- **SECOND carrier pair has held for 3 rounds** (if swapped Round 4)
- Priest will heal wounded enemies

**Round 7:**
- Carriers at ~90 feet, mid-Killing Field
- **At count 15: 2 Thugs spawn** (fresh reinforcements)
- **Announce: "Time for second swap!"**
- Thugs use Pack Tactics with existing enemies
- Multiple spike pits still threatening

**Round 8:**
- **No spawns** (brief respite)
- Carriers at ~100-110 feet
- Clear threats before Final Stretch
- Third carrier pair or maintain current

**Round 9:**
- Carriers at ~120-130 feet, exiting Killing Field
- **At count 15: 1 Gladiator spawns** (CR 5—MINI-BOSS)
- Gladiator has Multiattack (3 attacks), Parry, Shield Bash
- Platform collapse checks begin (DC 12 Athletics)
- Entering Final Stretch

**Round 10:**
- Carriers at ~140+ feet, into Final Stretch proper
- **3 Goblins drop from ceiling** (surprise if fail DC 12 Perception)
- Collapsing platforms active
- Goblins create chaos

**GM Focus:**
- Make first swap dramatic—describe coordination, trust, vulnerability
- Spike pits are serious threats (Perception checks, Dex saves)
- Scouts on platforms create ranged pressure—defenders must decide to climb or ignore
- Priest is control threat—paralyzing a defender is devastating with only 2
- Veteran threatens Shard HP directly—must be priority target
- Sand reduces visibility—enemies harder to spot before they attack
- Difficult terrain slows carriers to 10 feet/round (7 rounds to cross zone)
- If no swap by Round 4, carriers start making Con saves (track failures)

### Final Stretch (Rounds 11-14+, 140-210 feet)

**Round 11:**
- Carriers at ~150-160 feet
- **At count 15: 1 Berserker spawns** (CR 2, Reckless Attack)
- Platform collapse checks every 10 feet
- Defenders juggling multiple threats

**Round 12:**
- **No spawns** (brief respite)
- Carriers at ~170-180 feet
- Clear battlefield before final push
- Someone must prepare to unlock gate

**Round 13:**
- Carriers at ~190-200 feet, approaching gate
- **At count 15: 1 Veteran spawns** (final major threat)
- East Gate visible, locked
- Defender must unlock: Thieves' Tools DC 13 OR Athletics DC 15
- Breaking off a defender is risky with only 2

**Round 14+:**
- Gate opens
- Carriers push final 10 feet to goal
- Enemies make desperate attacks on Shard
- If delayed past Round 16: 1 Berserker spawns per round
- Carriers cross threshold = VICTORY

**GM Focus:**
- Third/fourth swaps happen in this zone—describe exhaustion mounting
- Platforms are treacherous—describe crumbling, creaking (7 platforms = 7 checks)
- Goblins are chaotic, annoying, but threatening in numbers
- Gladiator is serious threat—uses Parry to stay alive, multi-attacks to pressure
- Gate lock creates final obstacle—breaking off a defender when there's only 2 is brutal
- Build to climax: gate opening, Shard crossing, victory roar
- If Shard crosses East Gate threshold = instant victory
- With 4 PCs, Final Stretch is especially brutal—no backup, everyone exhausted

---

## The Burden Stone (Core Mechanic)

### Carrying Requirements
- **Exactly 2 PCs required** at all times (50% of party with 4 PCs!)
- Both use both hands (no weapons, shields, or items in hands)
- **Cannot make attacks** while carrying
- **Cannot cast spells** with somatic components
- **Cannot use items** (potions, scrolls, etc.)
- **Can make Strength (Athletics) checks** (grapple escape, shoves)
- **Can take Dodge action** (only defensive option)
- **With 4 PCs:** Everyone will carry eventually—no one sits out

### Movement
- Carriers move together (shared initiative or coordinate)
- Movement speed: **15 feet per round** (both must agree on movement)
- Difficult terrain affects them normally (barricades, sand)
- If separated more than 5 feet, Shard begins to slip (warning)
- If separated more than 10 feet, Shard drops (loud crack, reinforcements)

### Exhaustion Mechanics
- Every 3 rounds of carrying, carrier makes **DC 14 Constitution save**
- **Failure #1**: Gain 1 exhaustion level (disadvantage on ability checks)
- **Failure #2** (6 rounds): Auto-drop Shard, take 1d6 damage from strain
- **Solution**: Swap carriers every 3 rounds with fresh PCs

### Shard Vulnerability
- **AC 18, 50 HP** (track publicly)
- Enemies prioritize attacking Shard directly
- If dropped during swap: cracks audibly, enemy reinforcements arrive
- If dropped in enemy threatened square: enemies attack it immediately
- If reduced to 0 HP: Shard shatters—instant defeat, no rewards

### Shard Properties
- Glows brighter as it nears East Gate (cosmetic, builds tension)
- Weighs approximately 800 lbs (impossible for one person)
- Ancient magical artifact—radiates faint abjuration magic
- Cannot be stored, teleported, or moved by magic (must be carried physically)

---

## Swap Mechanics (Critical Cooperation)

### Swap Process
1. **All 4 PCs within 10 feet of Shard** (spatial requirement—entire party)
2. **Old carriers use action to release** (cannot attack this round)
3. **New carriers use action to lift** (cannot attack this round)
4. **Full round committed to swap** (most vulnerable moment—100% of party occupied)
5. **With 4 PCs:** No defenders during swap round—must clear area BEFORE swap begins

### Tactical Considerations
- **Announce swaps early**: "We swap on count 15—COVER US!"
- **Defenders push enemies back** before swap begins
- **Enemy readied actions**: Enemies will attack during swaps if able
- **Timing**: Swap before exhaustion (Round 3, 6, 9) or risk failure

### Failed Swap Scenarios
**If only 1 PC tries to carry:**
- Auto-failure, Shard drops
- Combat pauses while all scramble to lift (lose 1 round)
- Loud noise alerts enemies (no tactical surprise)

**If swapping in threatened space:**
- Enemies attack carriers during swap (opportunity attacks allowed)
- Risk of dropping Shard if carrier takes damage during transfer

**If not all PCs within 10 feet:**
- Swap attempt fails, old carriers must continue or drop Shard
- Lose momentum, waste actions

### Successful Swap
- Describe coordination, trust, smooth handoff
- Brief respite for old carriers (now defenders)
- New carriers feel full weight, strain begins anew
- Crowd cheers if executed cleanly (+1 Favor for all if no damage during swap)

---

## Enemy Spawn Schedule

### Wave Spawn Timing
At **initiative count 15** each round, new enemies spawn from side tunnels

**Round 1:** 3 Bandits (CR 1/8)
- HP: 11 each, AC 12
- Melee attackers, rush toward Shard

**Round 2:** 2 Thugs (CR 1/2)
- HP: 32 each, AC 11—Pack Tactics, focus on defenders

**Round 3:** 2 Scouts (CR 1/2)
- HP: 16 each, AC 13—Cunning Action, harass carriers from platforms

**Round 4:** No spawn (respite for swap)

**Round 5:** 1 Veteran (CR 3)
- HP: 58, AC 17—Multiattack, major threat to Shard

**Round 6:** 1 Priest (CR 2)
- HP: 27, AC 13—*hold person* (DC 13), heals wounded enemies

**Round 7:** 2 Thugs (CR 1/2)
- Fresh melee reinforcements

**Round 8:** No spawn (respite)

**Round 9:** 1 Gladiator (CR 5—MINI-BOSS)
- HP: 112, AC 16—Multiattack (3 attacks), Parry, Shield Bash

**Round 10:** 3 Goblins (CR 1/4) drop from ceiling
- HP: 7 each, AC 15—Nimble Escape, chaos

**Round 11:** 1 Berserker (CR 2)
- HP: 67, AC 13—Reckless Attack

**Round 12:** No spawn

**Round 13:** 1 Veteran (CR 3)
- Final major threat

**Round 14+:** 1 Berserker every round until victory

### Enemy Tactics by Priority

**Priority 1: Attack the Shard**
- If adjacent to Shard and carriers not blocking: attack Shard (AC 18)
- Deal weapon damage directly to Shard's 50 HP
- Veterans and Berserkers most dangerous to Shard (high damage)

**Priority 2: Grapple/Restrain Carriers**
- Bandits and Thugs attempt grapples (contested Athletics/Acrobatics)
- Drag carriers away from Shard (separate them = drop)
- Slow progress by restraining carriers

**Priority 3: Kill Defenders**
- Remove defenders to leave carriers vulnerable
- Focus fire on wounded defenders
- Priest uses *hold person* to remove defender from combat

**Readied Actions During Swaps:**
- Enemies within 30 feet ready attacks for when swap begins
- "I attack when they start swapping!"
- Punish poor swap timing/positioning

---

## Zone Hazards in Detail

### Starting Grounds (0-40 feet)

**Barricades:**
- Scattered wooden barriers (5 feet tall)
- Provide half-cover (+2 AC, +2 Dex saves)
- Difficult terrain to move through
- Can be destroyed (AC 15, 20 HP) for Panache

**Terrain:**
- Flat packed dirt
- Relatively open sightlines
- Easiest zone to navigate

**Tactical Notes:**
- Defenders use barricades for cover
- Carriers navigate around them (slows to 10 feet/round through difficult terrain)
- Good zone for establishing carrier rhythm

### Killing Field (40-80 feet)

**Spike Pits (2 total):**
- Location: 50 feet and 65 feet from West Gate
- Size: 10-foot × 10-foot squares
- **DC 13 Perception to spot** (passive works)
- **DC 13 Dexterity save to avoid** (if stepping into)
- **Damage: 2d6 piercing + restrained condition**
- Restrained: Speed 0, disadvantage on attacks, advantage on attacks against
- Escape: DC 13 Athletics or Acrobatics (action)

**Elevated Archer Positions:**
- Height: 15 feet above floor
- 2-4 Scout archers positioned
- **+2 to hit vs carriers** (size, slow movement)
- **Disadvantage to hit vs fast-moving defenders**
- Can be climbed (DC 13 Athletics) to neutralize

**Swirling Sand:**
- Entire zone is difficult terrain
- **Disadvantage on Perception checks** (poor visibility)
- Enemies harder to spot before they attack
- Carriers move only 10 feet/round here (difficult terrain + 15-foot speed = halved)

**Tactical Notes:**
- Most dangerous zone
- Spike pits can be used tactically (shove enemies into them)
- Archers create constant pressure on carriers
- Sand obscures enemy approach—surprise attacks likely
- Defenders must scout ahead, clear threats before carriers arrive

### Final Stretch (80-120 feet)

**Collapsing Platforms:**
- Series of unstable wooden platforms
- Every 10 feet traveled: **DC 12 Athletics check**
- **Failure: Platform collapses, 10-foot fall, 1d6 damage**
- Carriers must both succeed or both fail together
- Failed check doesn't stop movement, just deals damage

**East Gate (Locked):**
- Heavy iron gate at 120-foot mark
- **Locked: DC 13 Thieves' Tools** (action) OR **DC 15 Athletics** (action) to force
- Defender must break formation to unlock
- Gate has AC 19, 30 HP (can be destroyed if no tools/strength)

**Goblin Ambush:**
- 4 Goblins on ceiling rafters
- Drop when carriers enter zone (80-foot threshold)
- Surprise round if PCs fail DC 12 Perception
- Nimble Escape makes them annoying to pin down

**Tactical Notes:**
- Platforms are random danger—no skill fully prevents
- Gate creates final obstacle—planning required
- Goblins are chaos factor, split defender attention
- Final 20 feet are sprint to victory—all-out push

## Important Mechanics Reminders

### Exhaustion Tracking
Keep public tally on board:
- "First carriers: Round 1, Round 2, Round 3—SWAP NEEDED"
- "Second carriers: Round 4, Round 5..."

**Exhaustion Effects:**
- Level 1: Disadvantage on ability checks (including Athletics for platform checks)
- Level 2: Speed halved (carriers become 7-foot speed—devastating)
- Level 3: Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws
- **Max 2 levels from carrying** (Constitution saves prevent more)

**Con Save Tracking:**
- Round 3: First save for initial carriers (DC 14)
- Round 6: Second save if still carrying (DC 14, failure = 1 exhaustion)
- Round 6+: Third round = auto-drop + 1d6 damage (non-negotiable)

### Grapple and Drag Mechanics
**Enemy grapples carrier:**
1. Enemy attacks, hits
2. Contested check: Enemy Athletics vs Carrier Athletics or Acrobatics
3. If carrier fails: Grappled (speed 0, can't move)
4. **Other carrier cannot move Shard alone**—progress halts
5. Must break grapple (action) or defender must shove enemy off

**Dragging carriers apart:**
- If enemy grapples one carrier and drags them >10 feet from partner
- Shard drops (loud crack)
- Reinforcement wave spawns immediately
- Combat pauses 1 round to re-lift Shard

### Shard Damage Tracking
**Track openly:**
- Start: 50/50 HP
- After attack: "Shard takes 12 damage! Now 38/50!"
- At half HP: "Shard CRACKS! Spiderwebs spread across crystal!"
- At 10 HP or below: "One more hit could SHATTER it!"

**Enemy attacks:**
- Veterans: +5, 1d8+3 (avg 7-8 damage)
- Berserkers: +5, 1d12+3 (avg 9-10 damage)
- Bandits: +3, 1d6+1 (avg 4-5 damage)

**Rough math:** ~6-8 hits will destroy Shard if undefended

---

## Scaling Options

### For 4 Level 4 PCs (Baseline)
- Enemies as listed in spawn schedule (15-16 total)
- Shard: 50 HP, AC 18
- Path: 210 feet, 14-16 rounds expected
- Difficulty: Hard-to-Deadly encounter (constant pressure, only 2 defenders, 1 death likely)

### If Too Easy
- Replace Gladiator with full CR 8 Assassin (HP 78, poison, Assassinate)
- Add 1 Berserker to Round 11
- Reduce respites (spawn 1 Thug in Round 8 also)
- Add extra Veteran in Round 5

### If Too Hard
- Reduce Gladiator HP to 80 (closer to CR 4)
- Remove Priest from Round 6 entirely
- Grant Shard 65 HP instead of 50
- Allow 4-round carry before first Con save (instead of 3)
- Add third respite round (no spawn Round 10)

### If PCs Dominating
- Round 7 reinforcement: 2 Veterans + 1 Priest enter together
- Announcer: "The defenders are TOO STRONG! Send reinforcements!"
- Archers use special attacks (disadvantage on next attack for carrier hit)

### If PCs Struggling
- Reduce Shard AC to 16 (easier to defend)
- Narrator hints: "The barricade could provide cover for the swap..."
- Mysteriously, fewer enemies spawn Round 8 (crowd interference?)
- Snak throws healing potion from crowd (1 free action use)

## Session Pacing
`
**Target Duration:** 3-4 hours

**Time Breakdown:**
- Pre-session roleplay (Snak, planning, shop): 20-30 minutes
- Arena entrance, announcer intro: 10 minutes
- Rounds 1-3 (Starting Grounds + first swap): 60-80 minutes
- Rounds 4-6 (Killing Field + second swap): 60-80 minutes
- Rounds 7-9 (Final Stretch + finale): 40-60 minutes
- Post-combat aftermath, rewards: 15-20 minutes

**Pacing Tips:**
- Use round timer: "Swap in 1 round! Plan now!"
- Track progress visually: mark 40-foot, 80-foot, 120-foot lines
- Describe enemy spawns dramatically: "GATES OPEN! More enemies!"
- Skip trivial movement: "You advance 15 feet into Starting Grounds. Next?"
- Use announcer beats every 2-3 rounds for excitement
- Make swaps slow-motion dramatic—describe trust, coordination, vulnerability
- Build tension with Shard HP: "Shard at 22 HP! One more Veterans attack could END this!"
