## Session 2: The Gauntlet Run 🏃‍♂️
The gladiators face the Gauntlet—three zones, three waves, ten rounds of timed pressure combat. Goblins give way to hobgoblins before the legendary Bonecrusher the Ogre enters. The party's performance draws first patron interest.

## Session 3: The Butchers Block 🔪
Days later, four prisoners of war arrive: Rohm and three young teenage herders. Snak reveals someone wants the kids dead and recruits the party to keep them alive. The survivors face professional fighters, not beasts, with the crowd watching children thrown to the hyenas.

## Session 3: The First Glorious End 🪦
Death is guaranteed. Revivial is not.  The Rite of the Phoenix involves the players dying gloriously... but only 3 of the are revived. After a brutal battle against the Brutes across the ziplines, a Chimera tried to finish them off.
