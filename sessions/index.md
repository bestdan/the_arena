## Session Structure

Each session follows this repeatable format:

### 1. Between Bouts
Downtime activities, NPC interactions, patron meetings, injuries healing, rumors spreading

### 2. The Announcement
Theatrical introduction with announcer flair and crowd reactions—setting the stage for the battle

### 3. The Battle
Deadly combat (balanced for 4-6 PCs) featuring:
- Unique arena layouts and terrain
- Varied enemy types and tactics
- Environmental hazards and objectives
- Crowd interaction moments

### 4. The Aftermath
Consequences matter:
- Rewards based on performance
- Patron interest and political intrigue
- Reputation shifts
- Injuries and permanent deaths
- Hooks for future sessions

---

## Using These Sessions

### For GMs

Each session includes:
- **Setup files**: Narrative flow, announcer dialogue, Snak's briefings
- **Encounter files**: Tactical details, stat blocks, CR calculations, adjustments
- **Notes files**: Play reports, what worked, lessons learned

Sessions are designed to be:
- **Modular**: Mix and match encounters
- **Scalable**: Adjustment guidance for party size/level
- **Theatrical**: Built-in drama moments
- **Consequence-driven**: Real stakes, permanent outcomes

### For AI Assistants

When creating new sessions:
1. Follow the four-part structure (Between Bouts → Announcement → Battle → Aftermath)
2. Include announcer dialogue with theatrical flair
3. Integrate Panache, Crowd's Favor, and Last Stand mechanics
4. Create 3-5 Crowd's Favor opportunities per encounter
5. Always include consequence hooks for future sessions
6. Balance CR appropriately but favor "deadly" over "easy"
7. Make deaths meaningful, not arbitrary

See [sessions/AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for detailed session creation guidelines.

## Campaign Continuity

Sessions build on each other:
- **Recurring NPCs**: Snak, Merryn, rival gladiators, patrons
- **Reputation tracking**: Crowd remembers performances
- **Injury consequences**: Last session's wounds affect this session
- **Patron relationships**: Interest compounds over time
- **Rivalry development**: Enemies and allies emerge from shared battles

Death is permanent. Characters who fall stay fallen. The roster rotates to keep stakes real.
