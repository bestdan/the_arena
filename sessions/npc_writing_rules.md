# NPC Writing rules

**Important**
- NPCs don't know about DM rules, size references, die damage etc. Have them speak like normal people, not like NPCs in a game.

### Examples
*Do*
> "Sunlight will burn like a fireball, maybe half if you can find cover. Stay in sun too long and it will take it's toll, make you sluggish.

*Dont*
> "Sunlight damage: 2d6 fire every turn you start in it. Partial cover from shadow? Half damage. Stay in sun too long and you be heat-exhausted. 

*Do*:  
> Three stones scattered around the arena, a bit hard but not impossible to spot them.

*Don't*: 
> Three stones scattered around the arena, DC 12 Perception to spot them.
