# Session 6 Setup: Hunt the Hummingwym

### 3 Days After Session 5

The arena is still buzzing about the night hunt. Father Crow's group survived the hunters' gauntlet—barely. Torgana made death saves on the sand while the crowd chanted the final countdown. But they lived. That's what matters.

[[../../npcs/snak|Snak]] appears in the pen two days later, unusually cheerful.

> "Good news! You lot have earned a reputation—'hard to kill.' The bookies hate you, which means the Grand Master loves you. Also, Torgana, the masked assassin sends his regards and 50 gold pieces. Professional courtesy."

He tosses a small purse to Torgana.

> "Session Six is in three days. Something different this time—a hunt. Not you being hunted, for once. You'll be doing the hunting."

### The Night Before the Match

Snak arrives with his usual smirk and a leather scroll case.

> "Right then. Tomorrow's bout: 'Hunt the Hummingwym.' Ever seen one? No? Picture a hummingbird mated with a pseudodragon. Tiny, fast, glows like a rainbow, and smarter than it looks."

He unrolls a crude map of the arena—circular, with marked features.

> "The rules are simple: Catch it. Hold it until the timer runs out. Twelve rounds. Whoever's holding it at the end wins."

He pauses, his expression darkening.

> "Here's the catch—literally. If the Hummingwym dies while you're holding it, YOU die. Curse of the hunt. Instant. No death saves. So don't squeeze too hard, don't critical-hit the bloody thing, and for the love of all that's holy, don't let it take more than ten damage in one go."

He taps the map, indicating various features.

> "Arena's a garden maze of sorts. Stone pillars, thorn bushes—nasty ones, poison and bleeding if you're careless—sand pits for difficult terrain. Central fountain where it starts. Oh, and there's a special net hidden somewhere. First to find it gets advantage on catching the creature."

**If PCs paid for Snak's intel (50 gp), he provides additional details:**

> "The net's hanging from the East archway. Investigation check, DC 14, or DC 10 if you look specifically at the archways. One person can use it—grants advantage on grapple checks and attack rolls against the Hummingwym."

> "Five thorn bushes scattered around. Dex save DC 12 or take 1d6 piercing when you enter or start your turn inside. Fail by five or more, you also take poison damage and start bleeding. Medicine check DC 10 to stop the bleeding, or any magical healing works. Use the fountain to wash off poison if needed."

> "The Hummingwym has AC 17, only 15 hit points, but it's FRAGILE. Critical hits kill it. Ten damage in one hit kills it. Use grapple checks—DC 16 Athletics or Acrobatics—much safer. Or subdue it with careful attacks."

> "Moves 60 feet per turn for the first four rounds, 80 feet rounds five through eight, then 100 feet with wild zigzags in the final rounds. Random directions, rolled each round. You can use Animal Handling checks to predict where it's going—DC 12 for general direction, DC 15 for exact, DC 18 and you can ready an action with advantage."

> "You're not alone. Rival gladiators—four tough fighters and a Beast Handler. They'll chase the Hummingwym AND fight you. They know about the net too. Expect them to split their focus: some chasing, some blocking you."

> "Once someone catches it, it struggles. DC 13 Animal Handling at the start of your turn or it escapes. You can pass it to allies as a free action if they're adjacent. If you take ten or more damage while holding it, make a Concentration check DC 12 or drop it."

> "Win condition: Be holding the Hummingwym when Round 12 ends. If the rivals hold it, they win. If no one holds it, everyone loses and the crowd boos."

He rolls up the map.

> "Strategy? Find that net early. Use Animal Handling to predict its movement. Grapple it—don't attack unless you're very confident. Coordinate with your team—pass it around if needed. Watch out for the thorns; the rivals will shove you into them. And whatever you do, DON'T. KILL. IT."

**Without intel purchase, Snak keeps it brief:**

> "Beyond that, you're on your own. Figure out the arena, find any advantages you can, and don't kill the Hummingwym. Good luck."

### An Hour Before the Match in the Armory

The armory is stocked with standard gear. No special items this session—just weapons, armor, and basic equipment.

A young attendant offers nets, ropes, and javelins.

> "For the hunt, sirs and madams. Nets are popular. Just... be gentle with the creature, yes? The curse is real. We lost three gladiators to it last year in a similar bout."

The PCs can take:
- Standard nets (no magical bonus, but functional)
- Rope (50 feet)
- Javelins or throwing daggers
- Healing potions (if purchased previously)

### As You Walk Into the Arena

The gates open to bright daylight. The circular arena has been transformed into a wild garden—stone pillars rise from sand, thorn bushes create natural hazards, and a central fountain bubbles peacefully.

Four stone archways mark the cardinal directions. The crowd is already roaring.

The announcer's voice booms across the stands:

```
"CITIZENS OF TARSUS! Today we present—THE HUNT!"

[The crowd cheers]

"Five gladiators! One enchanted prey! And a DEADLY curse for those too careless!"

[A shimmering portal opens above the fountain. The Hummingwym appears—tiny, iridescent, wings humming]

"Behold—the HUMMINGWYM! Swift as lightning! Delicate as glass! Catch it—HOLD it—but do NOT kill it!"

[The creature hovers, rainbow scales catching the light]

"Twelve rounds! Whoever holds the prize when time expires claims VICTORY!"

[From the opposite gate, five rival gladiators enter, weapons ready]

"But you are not ALONE! Rivals seek the same prize! Will you FIGHT for it? Will you STEAL it? Will you SURVIVE?"

[The crowd stamps their feet rhythmically]

"Hunt begins... NOW!"

[A horn blast echoes. The Hummingwym darts from the fountain in a random direction. The rivals charge forward.]
```

The hunt is on.

## Key Reminders for Players

**Objective:**
- Hold the Hummingwym at end of Round 12 to win

**Death Curse:**
- If Hummingwym dies while you're holding it: Wisdom save DC 15 or drop to 0 HP instantly
- Critical hits kill it
- 10+ damage in one hit kills it
- **Use grapple checks (DC 16) instead of attacks—much safer!**

**Finding the Special Net:**
- Hidden somewhere in the arena (East archway if you bought intel)
- Grants advantage on catching attempts
- Only one person can use it

**Holding the Hummingwym:**
- DC 13 Animal Handling check at start of your turn or it escapes
- Can pass to adjacent ally as free action
- If you take 10+ damage, make DC 12 Concentration check or drop it

**Thorn Bushes:**
- Dex save DC 12 when entering or starting turn inside
- Failure: 1d6 piercing damage
- Failure by 5+: Also 1d4 poison damage and bleeding (1 damage per round until treated)
- Wash poison at fountain (action)

**Animal Handling Predictions:**
- DC 12: General direction (N/S/E/W quadrant)
- DC 15: Exact direction
- DC 18: Exact direction + ready action with advantage

**Strategy Tips:**
- **Find the net early** (advantage is huge)
- **Use grapple checks** instead of attacks (safer)
- **Study its movement** (Animal Handling to predict)
- **Pass it between allies** (share the burden)
- **Use thorns tactically** (shove enemies in, use for cover)
- **Don't get isolated** (rivals will swarm lone PCs)
- **Watch the timer** (only 12 rounds—positioning matters in final rounds)

Good hunting!
