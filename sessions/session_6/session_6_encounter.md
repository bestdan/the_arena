# Session 6 Encounter: Hunt the Hummingwym

## The Hummingwym Chase

**Party:** 5 PCs, level 3
**Objective:** Capture and hold the Hummingwym until the timer expires. If you don't hold it at the end, the rival team wins. Keep it alive—if it dies in your care, you die.
**Expected Outcome:** High-speed chase with strategic positioning, environmental hazards, and deadly consequences for careless handling.

---

## Arena Layout

Circular arena (100-foot diameter) with natural wilderness terrain. The arena has been transformed into a deadly garden chase course.

### Key Features

**Central Fountain** (20 feet across, 10 feet tall)
- Hummingwym emerges from here at start of Round 1
- Provides fresh water (can be used to wash off thorn poison)
- Partial cover; 5 feet tall stone rim

**Four Stone Archways** (North, South, East, West)
- Partial cover
- Hummingwym can dart through/around them
- 15 feet tall, 10 feet wide

**Scattered Pillars** (10 feet tall, 5 feet diameter)
- Total cover when crouching
- Hummingwym uses to break line of sight
- 6 pillars scattered throughout arena

**Thorn Bush Patches** (Environmental Hazard)
- Five patches of dense thorny vegetation (15-foot diameter each)
- Difficult terrain
- Entering or starting turn in thorns: DC 12 Dex save or 1d6 piercing damage
- Failed save by 5+: Also 1d4 poison damage and bleeding (1 damage per round until DC 10 Medicine check or magical healing)
- Provide half cover but at risk
- Hummingwym can fly over without issue

**Sand Pit Sections** (15-foot patches)
- Difficult terrain for PCs
- Not difficult for Hummingwym (it flies/hovers)
- 3 patches scattered around arena

**The Special Net** (Hidden)
- Hanging from one of the archways (East archway, Investigation DC 14 to notice, or DC 10 if actively searching archways)
- Athletics DC 13 to pull down and claim
- Only ONE player can use it
- Grants advantage on catching the Hummingwym (attack rolls or grapple checks)
- Can be stolen from holder (opposed Athletics check)
- If used to successfully catch Hummingwym: +3 Crowd Favor

## The Hummingwym

A magical creature combining the iridescent beauty of a hummingbird with the mischievous intelligence of a pseudodragon. Tiny size, rainbow-colored scales, rapid wings creating a distinctive hum.

### Stats
- **Speed:** 60 feet flying per turn (hovers, darts erratically)
- **AC:** 17 (tiny size, magical scales, evasive)
- **HP:** 15 (fragile—must be careful!)
- **Size:** Tiny
- **Intelligence:** 8 (animal intelligence, but clever)

### Special Abilities
- **Can't be grappled** except on successful Athletics or Acrobatics check DC 16 (requires being within 5 feet)
- **Immune to magic** that would hold/slow it (enchanted for the hunt)
- **Death Curse:** If the Hummingwym dies while in a PC's possession (grappled or within 5 feet and last to touch it), that PC must make a Wisdom save DC 15 or drop to 0 HP instantly (curse of the hunt)
- **Delicate Creature:** Any critical hit kills it instantly
- **Fragile:** Taking 10+ damage in a single hit kills it (even if under 15 total HP)

### Movement Pattern
- **Rounds 1-3:** Roll 1d8 each round—Hummingwym darts toward that compass direction (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) at full speed. If it hits a wall, it ricochets in a new random direction (1d8 again)
- **Rounds 4-6:** Accelerates to 80 feet per turn, still predictable (1d8 direction)
- **Rounds 7-8:** Moves 100 feet per turn, zigzags wildly (roll 1d8 twice, moves in both directions sequentially)

### Detection
- Glows faintly with iridescent shimmer
- Always visible due to glow and distinctive humming sound
- Sound can be heard up to 60 feet away

### Animal Handling Checks
- **DC 12:** Predict general direction Hummingwym will move next round (know which quadrant: N/S/E/W)
- **DC 15:** Predict exact direction (1d8 result)
- **DC 18:** Predict exact path and can ready an action to intercept with advantage
- Takes an action to study the Hummingwym's patterns

---

## Enemies (Rival Gladiators)

The rival team wants to catch the Hummingwym too. They'll fight PCs AND chase the creature. For 5 PCs, they're a significant threat.

### 5 PC Party Composition

**4 Rival Gladiators**
- Use **Bandit Captain** stats (CR 2 each)
- **HP:** 65 each
- **AC:** 15 (studded leather)
- **Attacks:** Scimitar +5 (1d6+3 slashing), Dagger +5 (1d4+3 piercing, ranged 20/60)
- **Special:** Multiattack (3 attacks)
- **Equipment:** Javelins (for throwing at PCs or Hummingwym), regular nets (disadvantage on catching compared to special net)

**1 Beast Handler**
- Use **Scout** stats (CR 1/2)
- **HP:** 16
- **AC:** 13 (leather armor)
- **Special:** Animal Handling expertise (+5)
- Attempts to predict Hummingwym movement and coordinate team

### Rival Team Strategy
- **Split Focus:** 2 gladiators chase Hummingwym, 2 gladiators block/fight PCs
- **Beast Handler:** Stays at mid-range (30 feet), shouts predictions about Hummingwym's path
- **Net Competition:** Rivals know about the special net—if they spot it first, they'll try to claim it
- **Holding Strategy:** Once a rival catches Hummingwym, others form protective circle and defend holder
- **Forced Drops:** Rivals will attack PCs holding Hummingwym to force drops (grapple, shove, damage)
- **Cautious at End:** In final rounds, rivals become MORE careful with damage—don't want to kill it

### Rival Behavior
- Will use regular nets (no advantage, but attempt to catch)
- Throw javelins to harass and slow PCs
- Use shoving and grappling to force Hummingwym drops
- If a PC is holding Hummingwym near thorns, will try to shove them into the thorns
- **Do not fight to death**—if losing badly (3+ allies down), survivors surrender

---

## Round Timer: 8 Rounds

## Catching the Hummingwym

Multiple methods to catch the delicate creature. **Be careful—killing it means death!**

### Methods

**Melee Attack (Subdual)**
- Hit AC 17 while within 5 feet
- Declare subdual damage before rolling
- If damage would reduce it to 0 HP or below, it's subdued (caught)
- **Risk:** Critical hit or 10+ damage in one hit kills it instantly
- Special net grants **advantage** on this roll

**Ranged Attack (Subdual)**
- Hit AC 17 with ranged attack (nets, bolas, etc.)
- Declare subdual damage
- Same risks as melee
- Special net (if thrown) grants **advantage**
- Range: 20/60 for special net

**Grapple Check**
- Get within 5 feet, use action
- Athletics or Acrobatics check vs. DC 16
- Success: Hummingwym is caught (grappled)
- Special net grants **advantage** on this check
- Safest method—no risk of killing

**Magic**
- *Hold person* fails (not a person)
- *Web*, *entangle*: Hummingwym makes save; if failed, it's restrained (easier to catch, AC reduced to 12)
- *Polymorph*, *banishment*: Disqualifies the caster (crowd deems unsporting—caster is attacked by arena guards)
- Damaging spells: High risk of killing the creature

### Holding the Hummingwym

**While Holding:**
- Hummingwym no longer moves on its own
- Holder can move normally but must keep one hand occupied
- Hummingwym struggles: DC 13 Animal Handling check at start of holder's turn or it escapes (breaks free, rolls new 1d8 direction and moves)
- Can pass Hummingwym to adjacent ally as a free action
- If holder takes 10+ damage in one hit: must make DC 12 Concentration check or drops Hummingwym

**Forcing Drops:**
- Grapple the holder (contested Athletics)
- Shove the holder (Athletics vs. Athletics or Acrobatics)
- Deal damage and force failed Concentration check
- Disarm attempts (if DM allows)

**Death Curse Trigger:**
- If Hummingwym dies AND you are holding it (or were last to touch it within 5 feet)
- Wisdom save DC 15
- **Failure:** Drop to 0 HP instantly (magical backlash)
- **Success:** Take 4d10 psychic damage and stunned until end of next turn

## GM Tips

### Tracking Hummingwym Movement
Create a simple movement tracker. Each round, roll 1d8 for direction:
- 1 = N, 2 = NE, 3 = E, 4 = SE, 5 = S, 6 = SW, 7 = W, 8 = NW

Mark on map where it moves. If it hits wall, reroll immediately.

**Rounds 7-8:** Roll twice for zigzag pattern.

### Death Curse Warnings
Make it VERY clear to players:
- Killing the Hummingwym while holding it = death save required
- Critical hits kill it instantly
- 10+ damage in one hit kills it
- Encourage grapple attempts over attacks

### Animal Handling Predictions
Reward clever players who use their action to study the creature:
- DC 12: Give general quadrant
- DC 15: Tell them exact 1d8 result before next move
- DC 18: They can ready action with advantage

This encourages non-combat approaches.

### Special Net Placement
Place the net somewhere visible but requiring effort:
- Hidden in East archway
- Investigation DC 14 (passive perception spots it)
- Or DC 10 if actively searching archways
- First to claim it gets advantage—creates early objective

### Rival Behavior Nuances
Rivals should feel competent but not overwhelming:
- They split focus (2 chase, 2 block)
- Beast Handler shouts predictions (helps rivals, but PCs can hear too)
- They use nets and javelins (not trying to kill Hummingwym)
- If losing badly, they surrender

### Thorn Bush Tactics
Encourage environmental use:
- Shove enemies into thorns
- Use thorns as cover (risky)
- Create barriers with thorns
- Wash poison at fountain

Track bleeding separately—1 damage per round until treated.

### Pacing the Hunt
**Early rounds (1-3):** Learning phase, exploring arena, finding net
**Mid rounds (4-6):** Active possession changes, combat heats up
**Late rounds (7-8):** Desperate scramble, careful handling, tactical positioning

### Passing the Hummingwym
Allies can pass the creature as a free action:
- Must be adjacent
- Automatic transfer
- New holder immediately makes Animal Handling check to maintain grip
- Creates dynamic teamwork opportunities

### Concentration Checks
When Hummingwym holder takes damage:
- 10+ damage in one hit = DC 12 Concentration check
- Failure = Hummingwym escapes
- This prevents damage from being auto-drop

---

## Aftermath Seeds

### Hummingwym Bonding (If PCs Win)
The Hummingwym, impressed by the PCs' skill and care, chooses to bond with the party.

**Mechanical Benefit:**
- Acts as a **Familiar** for one PC (their choice)
- Uses **Pseudodragon** stat block
- Can be summoned via *find familiar* if dismissed
- Grants advantage on Perception checks while perched on shoulder
- Once per day, can cast *faerie fire* (innate magic)

**Roleplay Benefit:**
- Companion NPC with personality
- Recognizes all 5 PCs as "its flock"
- Playful, curious, loyal
- Can scout, deliver messages, entertain

### Rival Grudge Match
The defeated rival gladiators are humiliated. Their leader swears revenge.

**Future Hook:**
- Session 8 or 9: Rematch demanded
- Rivals have trained, gained new tactics
- Personal stakes—they want to embarrass the PCs
- Patron politics involved (their sponsor vs. PC sponsor)

### Thorn Poison Lingering Effect
PC who took multiple thorn hits (3+ failed saves) has scarring.

**Temporary Effect (1d4 days):**
- Disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) due to visible scratches
- Advantage on Intimidation (looks battle-worn)
- Can show scars as "proof of arena survival" in social situations

### Special Net Ownership
The PC who claimed the special net can keep it as loot.

**Mechanical Item:**
- **Hunter's Net** (uncommon)
- Functions as normal net
- Grants advantage on attacks/checks to catch Tiny or Small beasts
- Can be thrown (20/60 range) or used in melee
- Worth 75 gp if sold

### Windstep Boots (For Imwe)
As a special reward for exceptional mobility and pursuit during the hunt, [[../../players/imwe|Imwe]] is awarded the **[[../../items/windstep_boots|Windstep Boots]]**.

**Mechanical Item:**
- **Windstep Boots** (uncommon, requires attunement)
- +10 ft walking speed
- Bonus action to Dash
- Advantage on Acrobatics checks (jumping, balance)
- **Windstep Surge** (3/day): Gain +30 ft speed, ignore difficult terrain, move through enemies, +2 AC for 1 minute
- **Risk:** DC 12 Dex save when moving 40+ feet or overshoot by 10 feet; collision damage 1d6

**Presentation:**
- Arena Master presents the boots personally
- "For the swiftest feet in the chase—may they carry you to glory!"
- Crowd cheers for Imwe's impressive performance

### Patron Interest: Beast Trainer
A noble patron who breeds exotic creatures is impressed.

**Offer:**
- 100 gp bonus payment
- Access to **Beast Handler's Guild**
- Future sessions might involve exotic creature hunts
- Can purchase trained animals at discount (pets, mounts, etc.)

### Political: Arena Ratings
The hunt was "thrilling" according to crowd surveys. Arena Master pleased.

**Consequence:**
- Future sessions might involve more "hunt" scenarios
- PCs gain reputation as "skilled trackers"
- Rival gladiators try to copy the format (imitation hunts)

### Injury: Death Curse Survivor
If a PC triggered the curse but survived (made the save):

**Permanent Mark:**
- Faint iridescent shimmer on hands (visible in bright light)
- Beasts can sense it—animals are either attracted or wary (50/50)
- Advantage on Animal Handling checks with birds specifically
- Disadvantage on Stealth in bright daylight (shimmer visible)

**Roleplay Hook:**
- "Marked by the Hunt"
- Other beast handlers recognize the mark
- Potential connection to druidic circles or beast cults

---

## Scaling Options

### Too Easy?
- Add 1 more Rival Gladiator (5 total rivals)
- Increase rival HP by 10 each
- Hummingwym moves faster (70/90/110 feet instead of 60/80/100)

- Reduce Hummingwym's AC to 15
- Death curse: easier save (DC 13)

### Someone Being Ignored?
- Have Beast Handler call out specific PC by name ("Watch out for [PC]!")
- Rivals target that PC specifically
- Hummingwym flies toward them (creating opportunity)
- Announcer highlights their actions

### Need More Chaos?
- Add flying insects (harmless but distracting)
- Random wind gusts (1d4 rounds, affects ranged attacks)
- Thorn bushes grow 5 feet each round (encroaching)
- Fountain sprays water randomly (lightly obscured area)

### Need Less Chaos?
- Remove 2 thorn bushes
