## Roleplaying Hooks

### Snak's Pre-Session Briefing
Snak should emphasize the danger:
- Death curse is REAL (remind them multiple times)
- Grapple is safer than attacking
- Net grants advantage (create early objective)
- Rivals are competent but not overwhelming

Tone: Helpful but sardonic. He wants them to succeed (he's bet on them), but won't coddle.

### Rival Gladiators Personality
Give the rivals some character:
- **Lead Gladiator (Karn):** Gruff, experienced, respects skill. Won't kill unnecessarily.
- **Second Gladiator (Vessa):** Aggressive, wants glory, will shove PCs into thorns.
- **Third Gladiator (Tormund):** Cautious, focuses on defense when holding Pygmy Wyvern.
- **Fourth Gladiator (Lira):** Quick, tries to steal net if she spots it.
- **Beast Handler (Finn):** Young, nervous, shouts predictions loudly (helps everyone, including PCs).

**Interaction Points:**
- Karn might nod respect if a PC makes a skilled catch
- Vessa trash-talks: "Too slow, gladiator!"
- Finn shouts predictions: "It's heading east! No, wait—southeast!"
- If losing badly, Karn calls surrender: "Enough! You've won!"

### Pygmy Wyvern Personality
The creature has personality:
- Playful but skittish
- Intelligent enough to recognize patterns
- Curious about PCs (might fly close to investigate)
- Loyal if caught gently (bonds with winner at end)

**Roleplay Moments:**
- Hovers near PCs briefly (within 10 feet) as if studying them
- Chirps and hums (musical sound, pleasant)
- If caught gently (grapple, not attack), it calms faster
- At end, nuzzles the winner affectionately

### Crowd Reactions
This is a unique hunt—crowd loves it:
- Gasps when someone gets close to catching
- Cheers when net is found
- Roars when someone is shoved into thorns
- Chants countdown in rounds 7-8
- Goes silent when death curse triggers (if it does)
- Erupts when Pygmy Wyvern is caught in Round 8

---

## Combat Flow Suggestions

### Opening (Rounds 1-3)
- Pygmy Wyvern emerges from fountain, hovers briefly
- Roll 1d8 for direction, moves 60 feet
- PCs and rivals both react—some chase, some search for net
- First Investigation checks for net (East archway, DC 14)
- Establish terrain—point out thorn bushes, sand pits, pillars

**GM Focus:**
- Describe Pygmy Wyvern's beauty and speed
- Emphasize fragility ("It's so small, so delicate...")
- Highlight environmental features
- Let players explore arena without immediate combat

### Early Chase (Round 3)
- Rivals engage PCs (2 chase Pygmy Wyvern, 2 block PCs)
- First combat exchanges begin
- Beast Handler (Finn) shouts predictions
- First attempts to catch Pygmy Wyvern (likely failures—AC 17 is tough)
- Possible net discovery and claim

**GM Focus:**
- Track initiative carefully (Pygmy Wyvern moves on initiative count 20)
- Encourage Animal Handling checks ("You can study its pattern with an action")
- Rivals use shove actions to push PCs into thorns
- Describe near-misses dramatically: "Your hand closes inches from its tail!"

### Mid-Hunt (Rounds 4-6)
- Pygmy Wyvern accelerates to 80 feet
- Possession likely changes hands (caught, stolen, escaped)
- Thorn bush casualties mount (bleeding effects)
- Combat intensifies—rivals get desperate

**GM Focus:**
- Track bleeding damage (1 per round until treated)
- Encourage fountain use (washing poison)
- Highlight teamwork opportunities (passing Pygmy Wyvern, protecting holder)
- Describe Pygmy Wyvern struggling in holder's grasp
- Call for Animal Handling checks to maintain grip

### Late Hunt (Rounds 7-8)
- Pygmy Wyvern zigzags (roll 1d8 twice per round, 100 feet total)
- Desperate scramble for possession
- Everyone becomes cautious (no one wants death curse)
- Tactical positioning crucial

**GM Focus:**
- Emphasize speed and chaos ("It's a blur of iridescent light!")
- Remind about death curse if someone gets reckless with damage
- Rival behavior shifts—more defensive if they're holding it
- Count down rounds audibly: "TWO rounds left!" then "FINAL ROUND!"

### Final Round (Round 8)
- Last chance positioning
- Holder tries to defend/evade
- Non-holders try to steal or protect
- Extreme caution with damage

**GM Focus:**
- Build tension ("This is IT!")
- Describe every action dramatically
- Crowd counts down with you: "TEN! NINE! EIGHT!"
- Freeze moment when horn blasts (end of Round 8)
- Zoom in on whoever holds the Pygmy Wyvern

---

## Important Mechanics Reminders

### Pygmy Wyvern Death Trigger
**Only triggers if:**
1. Pygmy Wyvern reduced to 0 HP or killed
2. PC is holding it OR was last to touch it (within 5 feet)

**Effect:**
- Wisdom save DC 15
- Failure: Drop to 0 HP instantly (no damage roll—just down)
- Success: 4d10 psychic damage and stunned until end of next turn

**Make it dramatic:**
- Describe magical backlash ("Rainbow light EXPLODES from the creature!")
- Crowd gasps or screams
- Other PCs can see it happen ("You watch as [PC] convulses, eyes glowing!")

### Grapple vs. Attack
**Encourage grapple:**
- Safer (no damage = no death risk)
- DC 16 Athletics or Acrobatics
- Net grants advantage (becomes +5 average on roll)
- Automatic catch on success

**Attacks are risky:**
- Must hit AC 17
- Must declare subdual
- Crit kills it instantly
- 10+ damage kills it (even if total HP remaining)
- Net grants advantage on attack roll

### Animal Handling to Predict Movement
**Action economy trade-off:**
- Spend action to study Pygmy Wyvern
- Make Animal Handling check
- **DC 12:** "It seems to be favoring the eastern side" (quadrant)
- **DC 15:** "It's going to dart northeast next" (exact 1d8 result)
- **DC 18:** Exact direction + can ready action with advantage

**Reward high rolls:**
- DC 18 essentially guarantees next catch attempt succeeds
- Describe the PC reading body language: "You notice its head tilts slightly before each turn..."

### Concentration Check for Dropping
**When holder takes 10+ damage in one hit:**
- DC 12 Concentration check (or half damage, whichever is higher)
- Failure: Pygmy Wyvern escapes, moves randomly

**Note:** War Caster feat or similar abilities apply

## Environmental Hazards Detail

### Thorn Bushes (5 total)
**Locations (suggested):**
1. Northwest quadrant (between fountain and north archway)
2. Northeast quadrant (near east archway—near the net!)
3. Southeast quadrant
4. Southwest quadrant
5. Western edge (between two pillars)

**Mechanics:**
- Entering or starting turn inside: Dex save DC 12
- Failure: 1d6 piercing
- Failure by 5+: Also 1d4 poison + bleeding
- Bleeding: 1 damage per round (automatic, no save)
- Treatment: DC 10 Medicine check (action) or magical healing

**Tactical Use:**
- Shove enemies in (Athletics vs. Athletics/Acrobatics)
- Half cover if crouching inside (but taking damage)
- Use to block movement paths
- Describe vividly: "Wicked thorns as long as daggers, glistening with poison"

### Fountain
**Benefits:**
- Wash poison (action, removes poison damage and bleeding)
- High ground on rim (5 feet up, +1 to ranged attacks)
- Splash zone if combat nearby (lightly obscured, 10-foot radius)

**Describe:** "Cool, clear water bubbles from ancient stone spouts. It looks refreshing."

### Sand Pits (3 total)
**Locations (suggested):**
1. Southern edge
2. Western quadrant
3. Eastern quadrant

**Mechanics:**
- Difficult terrain (2 feet of movement per 1 foot traveled)
- No save, just slows movement
- Pygmy Wyvern unaffected (flies over)

**Tactical Impact:**
- Slows pursuit
- Disadvantage if trying to catch Pygmy Wyvern while in sand
- Describe: "Loose sand shifts under your feet, slowing your sprint"

### Pillars (6 total)
**Scattered throughout arena**
- 10 feet tall, 5 feet diameter
- Full cover if behind
- Can climb (Athletics DC 12)
- Pygmy Wyvern uses to break line of sight

**Tactical Use:**
- Cover from ranged attacks (javelins, thrown nets)
- High ground for observation
- Describe: "Ancient stone columns, weathered but sturdy"

**Rounds 7-8: Final Push**
- Extreme caution if holding Pygmy Wyvern (no big damage attacks)
- Defensive positioning around holder
- Surrender if 4+ rivals down
- Pygmy Wyvern at maximum speed (100 feet, zigzagging)

### Surrender Conditions
**Rivals surrender if:**
- 4 or 5 rivals reduced to 0 HP
- Round 6+ and they have no hope of getting Pygmy Wyvern
- Karn's HP below 20 and at least 2 others down

**Surrender Dialogue:**
- Karn: "Enough! We yield! The prize is yours!"
- Drops weapons, backs away
- Crowd cheers (respects honorable surrender)
