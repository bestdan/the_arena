# AGENTS: sessions/

Use this guide when drafting or revising session notes. Keep the Arena theatrical and consequence-heavy.

## Load This Context First
- `AGENTS.md` and `environment/the_empire.md` for world framing.
- Mechanics: `mechanics/panache_mechanics.md`, `mechanics/crowds_favor_mechanic.md`, `mechanics/last_stand.md`.
- Current cast: `player_characters/characters.md`; add relevant `npcs/*.md` for featured characters.

## Session Format (keep consistent)
1. Pre-session interactions: character moments, NPC conversations, world hooks.
2. Announcer dialogue: use code blocks for hype and stage directions.
3. Combat encounters: deadly for 3-6 PCs considering their level; spotlight crowd reactions and style.
4. Post-combat aftermath: rewards, patron interest, reputation shifts, injuries or deaths.
5. Between-session events: downtime that seeds the next setup.

### Announcer Block Example
```
[Crowd rises, banners snapping]

"Welcome back to the blood-soaked sands!"

[Trumpets blare; nobles lean forward]
```

## Writing Rules
- Keep the crowd and announcer present to reinforce spectacle.
- Call out when custom mechanics apply ([[panache_mechanics|Panache]], [[crowds_favor_mechanic|Crowd Favor]], [[last_stand|Last Stand]]).
- Track consequences and continuity (wounds, debts, patron favors).
- Link named NPCs, locations, and mechanics using Obsidian wiki-link syntax.
- Aim for concise headings and bullets where it helps scanning; otherwise flow with narrative prose.
