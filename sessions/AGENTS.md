# AGENTS: sessions/

Use this guide when drafting or revising session notes. Keep the Arena theatrical and consequence-heavy.

## Load This Context First
- `AGENTS.md` and `environment/the_empire.md` for world framing.
- Mechanics: `mechanics/panache.md`, `mechanics/crowds_favor.md`, `mechanics/last_stand.md`.
- Current cast: `players/characters.md`; add relevant `npcs/*.md` for featured characters.

## Organization
- create 3 files per session: 
  - `session_x_pregame.md` which holds pre-session info
  - `session_x_game.md` holds details of how to run the sessions: npcs, enemies, environment changes etc
  -  `session_x_notes.md` holds notes from the played session, actions taken favor granted, items taken, plot lines developed etc


## Session Format (keep consistent)
1. Pre-game interactions: character moments, NPC conversations, world hooks.
2. Announcer dialogue: use comment blocks for hype. Be quick, do not overindulge in crowd commentary. 
3. Combat encounters: deadly for 3-6 PCs considering their level; spotlight crowd reactions and style.
4. Post-combat aftermath: rewards, patron interest, reputation shifts, injuries or deaths.
5. Between-session events: downtime that seeds the next setup.

### Announcer Block Example
```
[Crowd rises, banners snapping]

"Welcome back to the blood-soaked sands!"

[Trumpets blare; nobles lean forward]
```

## Writing Rules
- Keep the crowd and announcer present to reinforce spectacle.
- Call out when custom mechanics apply ([[panache|Panache]], [[crowds_favor|Crowd Favor]], [[last_stand|Last Stand]]).
- Track consequences and continuity (wounds, debts, patron favors).
- Link named NPCs, locations, and mechanics using Obsidian wiki-link syntax.
- Aim for concise headings and bullets where it helps scanning; otherwise flow with narrative prose.

**Note on visibility**
Never link to files which do not have `visibility: public` in their front matter.
