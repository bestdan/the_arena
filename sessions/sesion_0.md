In a holding pen are twenty people new participants. Some obviously know each other, others are stranger to all. There are some who are desolate. There are some brimming with excitement.

This is a mid weekday performance. You are no draw, but time is money and matinees still bring in a few onlookers.

A gruff looking orc woman arms bearing a leather armor vest comes enters the room. She hooks her fingers into the vest looks around at you and smiles.

     Welcome. My name is [[Snak]]. I'm here to give you the best chance possible. Which isn't great, but the dead don't pay partials. Looks like some of you already know each other, fair enough. For the rest, if you survive the next half hour, I'll learn your name. For now, you'll be going up against animals, so pick your equipment accordingly.

In the next hall are weapons and equipment of all sorts. All of it well made, none of it remarkable.

At the end of the hall is a portculis. Pick your weapons. We start in 5 minutes.
