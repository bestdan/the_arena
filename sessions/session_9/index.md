# Session 9: The Chrono-boros

## Overview

**Session Number:** 9
**Party Level:** 5 PCs, Level 5
**Difficulty:** Deadly (Tactical Puzzle)
**Theme:** Temporal paradox, asymmetric combat, strategic focus fire
**Expected Duration:** 10-12 rounds, 3-4 hours

A temporal combat encounter where past and future collide in a deadly ouroboros. Two warriors locked in time—a legendary knight protecting his younger mage self, and an ascended chronomancer protecting his younger knight self. The arena shifts between timelines every 3 rounds.

**The Puzzle:** Kill BOTH weak versions (Apprentice Mage in Past, Young Squire in Future) to break the temporal cycle.
