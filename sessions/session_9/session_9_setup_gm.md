# Session 9 GM Setup: The Chrono-boros

## Pre-Session Checklist

**Party Composition:**
- 5 PCs, level 5
- Expected: Mix of melee, ranged, and spellcasters
- Check for: *Counterspell*, healing abilities, mobility
- Key: Strategic thinking and temporal coordination matter more than raw damage
- **Critical:** With 5 PCs, action economy heavily favors party—enemies compensate with control magic and legendary actions

**Mechanics to Review:**
- [[../../mechanics/crowds_favor|Crowd Favor]] system
- [[../../mechanics/panache|Panache]] for creative plays
- Timeline shift mechanics (every 3 rounds)
- Lair actions (Initiative Count 20)
- Legendary actions (Knight Prime only)
- Separate HP pools for each timeline version
- Exhaustion conditions (from *slow* spell)
- Concentration checks (for Ascendant's *haste* and *slow*)

**Key Resources:**
- Round counter (track publicly for timeline shifts)
- Timeline indicator (Past/Future hourglass visual)
- Four separate HP trackers:
  - Past: Knight Prime (112 HP), Apprentice (35 HP)
  - Future: Ascendant (78 HP), Young Squire (55 HP)
  - Temporal Echoes (27 HP each × 2-3)
- Initiative tracker with lair actions at count 20
- Environmental feature markers (crystals, braziers, cover)
- Lair action selection guide (reference sheet)
- Temporal Mote familiar tracker (5 HP, AC 12)

**Session Goal:**
- High-tension tactical puzzle emphasizing asymmetric combat
- Reward strategic planning (focus fire, bypass strong enemies)
- Create memorable timeline shifts (dramatic environment changes)
- Showcase temporal paradox theme (protect past/future selves)
- Make weak target kills feel climactic—breaking the ouroboros

## Roleplaying Hooks

### Snak's Pre-Session Briefing
Snak should emphasize the temporal puzzle aspect:

> "This one's different. Two fighters across time—each powerful in their own era, each protecting their weaker self. You'll fight in two arenas that shift back and forth. Past has a strong knight protecting a weak mage. Future has a strong mage protecting a weak knight."

> "The trick? Kill BOTH weak versions. Kill just one and the strong survivor brings them back after the fight ends. You have to break the cycle completely—past AND future—or you'll be fighting them again in a minute."

> "Timeline shifts every three rounds. You'll know it's coming—the hourglass speeds up, announcer warns you. When it shifts, the environment changes, different enemies appear. Damage persists, but which enemies you face depends on the era."

Tone: Intrigued and tactical. This is a rare arena event—temporal magic is expensive. She's curious how they'll approach the puzzle. She should emphasize thinking strategically over just dealing damage.

### Announcer Characterization
The announcer should emphasize the temporal paradox and ouroboros cycle. Tone: Mystical at start, excited during combat, awed at timeline shifts.

**Key Announcer Beats:**
- Opening: "THE TEMPORAL OUROBOROS! Past and future collide!"
- Timeline shifts: "TIME REWINDS!" / "MILLENNIA LEAP FORWARD!"
- Weak version damaged: "The cycle STRAINS!"
- First weak version killed: "ONE link BREAKS!"
- Both weak versions killed: "THE OUROBOROS DIES! TIME UNRAVELS!"

### Enemy Communication
- **Ascendant (Future):** Confident, speaks in temporal metaphors. "You are already defeated—I have SEEN your failure!" Commands the young squire: "Hold them, young one! Fight with courage you'll one day master!"
- **Apprentice (Past):** Nervous, relies on knight. "Master, protect me! I'm not ready!" Casts spells hesitantly.
- **Knight Prime (Past):** Gruff, protective. "Stay behind me, boy. I won't fail you." Silent when protecting.
- **Young Squire (Future):** Eager, naive. "For the master! I won't let you through!" Fights enthusiastically but predictably.
- **Temporal Echoes:** Hollow, unsettling. "I was you... until the arena took everything..." "Why did you choose THIS path?"
- **Temporal Mote (Familiar):** Emits faint ticking sounds, leaves distortion trails. No speech, but responds to Ascendant's will.

---

## Combat Flow Suggestions

### Pre-Combat (Round 0)
- PCs enter arena, see FUTURE timeline first (Temporal Sanctum)
- Gleaming crystal chamber, floating crystals, central orrery
- Chrono-Mage Ascendant visible behind orrery, Temporal Mote hovering nearby
- Young Squire stands guard in front of mage
- Arena chronomancer demonstrates the two timelines using arcane projection
- Shows Past timeline briefly: war-torn battlefield, legendary knight, young apprentice
- Two arcane hourglasses above arena show which timeline is active
- Announcer delivers opening speech emphasizing ouroboros cycle
- **Give PCs 30 seconds to ask questions**—Who do we fight first? Do timelines affect us?
- Roll initiative; note lair action at count 20

**GM Focus:**
- Set mystical, temporal tone—this is about TIME
- Emphasize two timelines, shifting environment
- Make sure players understand: kill BOTH weak versions
- Clarify: Past = strong knight/weak mage, Future = strong mage/weak knight
- Visual: hourglasses, projected timelines, temporal effects

### Future Timeline - Rounds 1-3 (Highest Pressure)

**Round 1:**
- Ascendant wins initiative likely (gift of alacrity gives +1d8)
- **Ascendant opens:** Casts *slow* on 4-5 clustered PCs (DC 17 Wis save—very difficult)
  - Describe dramatically: "Time CRAWLS around you! Every motion feels like moving through tar!"
- **Young Squire:** Activates *haste* bead (bonus action), rushes forward enhanced
  - AC 18, +5 to hit, 40 ft. speed, extra action per turn
- **Temporal Mote:** Stays within 10 feet of Ascendant, providing occasional Help or scouting
- **Lair Action (Count 20):** Chronal Anchor on biggest melee threat
  - "FROZEN in a moment! Time holds them STILL!"

**Round 2:**
- Ascendant uses *counterspell* liberally (DC 17, +9 to hit)
  - Priority: PC healing, buffs, damaging spells
- Ascendant uses *Momentary Stasis* on most dangerous PC (DC 17 Con save)
  - "A moment stretched to ETERNITY! They can only WATCH!"
- Young Squire fights enthusiastically but predictably
  - Extra *haste* action for second attack or Dash
- Ascendant uses Temporal Aegis (reaction) to protect Young Squire when targeted
  - "+5 AC! The master's magic SHIELDS the squire!"
- **Lair Action (Count 20):** Mirror of Ages
  - All creatures DC 14 Int save or disadvantage on next attack/check

**Round 3:**
- **Timeline shift warning at count 12:** "TIME SHIFTS! The Past approaches!"
- **Lair Action (Count 20):** TEMPORAL ECHOES SPAWN (replaces normal lair action)
  - 2-3 Echoes emerge from orrery
  - Describe: "From timelines UNMADE, your own ECHOES emerge!"
  - Echoes use Phase Step immediately to reach backline
- Ascendant continues control (more *counterspell*, *Momentary Stasis*)
- Young Squire likely heavily damaged by now (5 PCs focus fire)
- If Young Squire dies: Ascendant uses Master's Will (reaction) to revive at 1 HP
  - "The squire FALLS! But the master RESURRECTS him from pure TIME!"

**At end of Round 3:** Timeline shifts to PAST

**GM Focus:**
- *Slow* is BRUTAL—DC 17 Wis save, PCs likely fail 2-3
- Track who's slowed (speed halved, -2 AC/Dex saves, no reactions, can't use bonus actions)
- Ascendant stays behind orrery (full cover)—PCs must close or use AoE
- Young Squire enhanced by *haste* is slippery but not deadly
- Temporal Mote is minor threat—mostly flavor, occasional Help action
- Echoes spawning Round 3 is chaos moment—backline suddenly pressured
- This is HARDEST phase happening FIRST—PCs learn the hard way

### Past Timeline - Rounds 4-6 (Control After Minions)

**Round 4:**
- **Environment changes:** Crystal chamber vanishes, war-torn battlefield appears
- Ascendant and Young Squire vanish (remain at current HP for Rounds 7-9)
- Knight Prime and Apprentice appear at same positions
- **Announce positions clearly:** "The legendary knight stands before the young mage!"
- **Knight Prime:** Position within 10 feet of Apprentice (Guardian's Oath: advantage, AC 20)
  - Makes three longsword attacks (+7, 1d8+4 slashing + 1d6 force each)
- **Apprentice:** Casts *hold person* on biggest melee threat (DC 13 Wis save)
  - "You will not TOUCH him!" Stays behind knight
- **Echoes (if alive):** Continue harassing backline from Future timeline
- **Lair Action (Count 20):** Accelerate Time
  - Knight and Apprentice gain +10 ft movement, can Dash as bonus action

**Round 5:**
- Knight Prime uses Shield Bash aggressively (push PCs away from Apprentice)
  - Bonus action: +7, 1d4+4 bludgeoning, target pushed 5 feet
- Knight uses legendary actions (3/round):
  - **Protective Parry:** Impose disadvantage on attack vs Apprentice
  - **Guardian's Advance:** Move toward Apprentice without opportunity attacks
  - **Temporal Slash (2 actions):** Extra longsword attack
- Apprentice uses *magic missile* (auto-hit, 3 darts × 1d4+1)
  - Casts *shield* reactively if targeted (+5 AC, AC 20 total)
- **Lair Action (Count 20):** Temporal Fracture
  - 20-foot radius, DC 14 Dex save, 2d8 force damage + pushed 10 ft random direction

**Round 6:**
- **Timeline shift warning at count 12:** "TIME SHIFTS! The Future returns!"
- Knight Prime desperately protects Apprentice
  - Uses all three legendary actions for Protective Parry if Apprentice threatened
- Apprentice likely low HP (PCs focusing fire)
  - If cornered, uses *misty step* behind altar (full cover)
  - If reduced to 0 HP: Temporal Anchor activates (freeze 1 round, Knight can rescue)
    - "The apprentice FREEZES in time! The knight has ONE ROUND to save him!"
- **Lair Action (Count 20):** Chronal Anchor
  - Lock down biggest DPR threat before timeline shifts
- **Arena's Mercy may trigger** if party below 60% total HP

**At end of Round 6:** Timeline shifts back to FUTURE

**GM Focus:**
- Knight Prime is TANK—112 HP, AC 20 with Guardian's Oath, multiattack
- Apprentice is FRAGILE—35 HP, AC 15, needs Knight's protection
- Knight's legendary actions are key—Protective Parry every round
- Apprentice's *hold person* can lock down one PC (DC 13 Wis save)
- Temporal Anchor (when Apprentice hits 0 HP) is dramatic—Knight must reach and rescue
- Echoes still present, continue backline harassment
- PCs should realize: kill Apprentice NOW or fight him again later

### Future Timeline - Rounds 7-9 (Escalation Phase)

**Round 7:**
- **Environment changes back:** Battlefield vanishes, crystal chamber returns
- Knight Prime and Apprentice vanish (remain at current HP for Rounds 10-12)
- Ascendant and Young Squire reappear (at HP from Round 3)
- **Critical Check:** Is Young Squire still alive?
  - If alive: returns with remaining HP, still *hasted*
  - If dead (killed Rounds 1-3): only Ascendant appears, fighting desperately
- **Lair Action (Count 20):** Temporal Rewind - Minor
  - Heal Young Squire or Ascendant for 2d10 HP
  - "Wounds UNMAKE themselves!"

**Round 8:**
- **CRITICAL DECISION POINT:** Are both weak targets still alive?
  - If YES: Use **Temporal Rewind - Major Escalated** (heal 3d10+10 to both)
  - If NO: Use **Chronal Anchor - Escalated** (target 2 PCs, DC 15, 2 turns duration)
- Ascendant fights more aggressively if Young Squire dead
  - *Disintegrate* on wounded PC (10d6+40 force damage, DC 17 Dex save or disintegrated)
  - "ERASURE! The master unweaves their EXISTENCE!"
- Ascendant uses *dimension door* if cornered (teleport 500 ft)
- Temporal Mote continues supporting Ascendant

**Round 9:**
- **Timeline shift warning at count 12:** "TIME SHIFTS! The Past returns!"
- Ascendant uses remaining high-level spells
  - *Wall of force* to divide party
  - *Cone of cold* for area damage (8d8 cold, DC 17 Dex save)
- Young Squire (if alive) makes desperate stand
  - Uses Novice's Determination if reduced to 0 HP (DC 12 Con save, drop to 1 HP)
- **Lair Action (Count 20):** Temporal Fracture - Escalated
  - 25-foot radius, DC 15 Dex save, 3d8 force damage + pushed 10 ft
- **Expected:** Young Squire killed this phase if not already dead

**At end of Round 9:** Timeline shifts to PAST

**GM Focus:**
- This phase determines encounter success
- If Young Squire still alive, Temporal Rewind - Major healing creates urgency
- Ascendant's *disintegrate* is lethal—target wounded PCs (50-60 damage average)
- *Dimension door* lets Ascendant reposition when cornered
- Temporal Mote provides occasional advantage via Help action
- Young Squire's death is major milestone—one link broken
- Escalated lair actions significantly more dangerous

### Past Timeline - Rounds 10-12 (Endgame)

**Round 10:**
- **Environment changes:** Back to ancient battleground
- Ascendant and Young Squire vanish
- Knight Prime and Apprentice reappear (at HP from Round 6)
- **Critical Check:** Is Apprentice still alive?
  - If alive: returns with remaining HP, Knight still has legendary actions
  - If dead (killed Rounds 4-6): Knight is ENRAGED (advantage on attacks, resistance to all damage, no legendary actions)
    - "THE PAST IS BROKEN! The knight enters RAGE! FURIOUS! UNSTOPPABLE!"
- **Lair Action (Count 20):** Accelerate Time - Escalated
  - All enemies +15 ft movement, Dash as bonus, advantage on next attack

**Round 11:**
- Knight Prime fights desperately
  - If Apprentice alive: uses all legendary actions for Protective Parry
  - If Apprentice dead: Enraged, makes reckless attacks with advantage
- Apprentice (if alive) likely killed this round
  - Uses Temporal Anchor when reduced to 0 HP
  - Knight attempts rescue with Guardian's Advance
- **Lair Action (Count 20):** Temporal Rewind - Major Escalated
  - If both weak targets alive: heal 3d10+10 to both (desperate)
  - If one dead: heal 3d10+10 to remaining weak target

**Round 12:**
- **Final push:** PCs should be overwhelming remaining enemies
- Knight Prime last stand
  - If enraged: resistance to all damage makes him tanky but manageable
  - Makes final multiattack (three longsword attacks)
- **Lair Action (Count 20):** Causality Cascade - Escalated
  - All PCs take 1d10 force per attack made, disadvantage on next damage roll
  - Final punishment for sustained offense
- **Victory likely this round** if PCs played tactically

**GM Focus:**
- Knight Prime enraged is dangerous but predictable
- If Apprentice alive, Knight defends to the death
- Temporal Anchor rescue attempt is dramatic moment
- Apprentice's death is second link broken—ouroboros dying
- When both weak versions dead: remaining strong versions vanish (temporal paradox)
- Victory feels earned—tactical puzzle solved

## The Temporal Ouroboros (Core Mechanic)

### Four Separate HP Pools (CRITICAL)
Track each version independently:
- **Past Timeline:**
  - Temporal Knight Prime: 112 HP
  - Chrono-Mage Apprentice: 35 HP
- **Future Timeline:**
  - Chrono-Mage Ascendant: 78 HP
  - Temporal Knight - Young Squire: 55 HP
- **Minions:**
  - Temporal Echoes: 27 HP each (2-3 total)
  - Temporal Mote (familiar): 5 HP

### Timeline-Locked Appearances
- Only enemies matching current timeline appear
- When timeline shifts, active enemies vanish, others appear
- HP persists when entities reappear later
- **Example:** Young Squire takes 40 damage Rounds 1-3 → Timeline shifts → Returns Round 7 at 15/55 HP

### Victory Condition
Kill BOTH weak versions:
- Apprentice Mage (Past, 35 HP)
- Young Squire (Future, 55 HP)

If only one weak version dies:
- Remaining strong version fights until defeated or PCs die
- If strong version survives encounter, resurrects counterpart after 1 minute
- Fight restarts (partial failure)

When both weak versions die:
- Temporal paradox resolves
- Remaining strong versions vanish (ouroboros broken)
- Victory

---

## Timeline Shift Mechanics

### Shift Timing
Every 3 rounds, at the end of the round:
- Round 3: Future → Past
- Round 6: Past → Future
- Round 9: Future → Past
- Round 12: Past → Future
- Continue alternating

### Shift Warning (Initiative Count 12, round BEFORE shift)
- Hourglass sand accelerates visibly
- Announcer shouts: "TIME SHIFTS! The [next era] approaches!"
- Gives PCs 1 round to prepare

### Environmental Translation
When timeline shifts, PCs and enemies remain in roughly same positions, but environment changes:
- **Weapon rack (Past)** ↔ **Floating crystal (Future)**
- **Bloodstained altar (Past)** ↔ **Central orrery (Future)**
- **War banner pole (Past)** ↔ **Temporal mirror (Future)**
- **Ancient brazier (Past)** ↔ **Arcane circle (Future)**

Example: PC standing next to weapon rack in Past → Timeline shifts → Now standing next to floating crystal in Future at equivalent position

### Active Enemy Swap
- Enemies present in current timeline vanish when timeline shifts
- Enemies for new timeline appear in equivalent positions
- **Describe dramatically:** "Reality FLICKERS! The legendary knight vanishes! The ascended mage materializes!"

---

## Environmental Interactions

### Temporal Sanctum (Future)

**Floating Crystals (6 total):**
- AC 15, 20 HP each
- When destroyed: 2d8 force damage, 10-foot radius, DC 14 Dex save
- **Tactical:** PCs can destroy crystals near Ascendant to damage him
- **Scaling:** +2 Favor for destroying 3+ crystals and catching Ascendant in explosions

**Arcane Circles (3 total):**
- 15-foot diameter, north/south/center
- **Standing in circle:** Advantage on saves vs. time magic, disadvantage on weapon attacks
- **Tactical:** Casters stand in circles for advantage vs. *slow*, *hold person*
- **Trade-off:** Martials avoid circles (disadvantage on attacks)

**Central Orrery:**
- 20 feet across, provides full cover
- Ascendant uses as primary defensive position
- **Sabotage:** DC 15 Arcana check (action) → Ascendant has disadvantage on concentration for 1 minute
- **Tactical:** +2 Favor for successful sabotage

**Temporal Mirrors (4 total):**
- 15 feet tall, positioned N/S/E/W
- Can be shattered for difficult terrain (5-foot square)
- **Potential:** Reflect spell effects (GM discretion, creative use)

---

### Ancient Battleground (Past)

**Weapon Racks (4 total):**
- Can grab improvised weapons (1d6 damage)
- Can topple for half-cover (action, 5-foot barrier)
- **Tactical:** Create cover for ranged PCs

**Ancient Braziers (2 total):**
- **Bonus action to stoke:** 10-foot bright light
- **Action to tip:** 2d6 fire damage, 10-foot cone, DC 13 Dex save
- **Tactical:** +2 Favor for tipping brazier onto enemies

**Bloodstained Altar:**
- 10 ft × 5 ft × 4 ft tall
- Provides full cover
- Knight Prime uses for Last Stand positioning

---

## Lair Actions - Detailed Guide

### When to Use Each (Rounds 1-7)

**Chronal Anchor (Control):**
- Best vs. high-DPR threats (Barbarian, Rogue, Paladin)
- Synergizes with Ascendant's *slow*
- Use Rounds 1, 6 (lock down threats before shifts)

**Temporal Fracture (Damage + Positioning):**
- Damages clustered PCs, pushes them into hazards
- Use Round 5 (damage spike after minion spawn)

**Temporal Rewind - Minor (Healing):**
- Use when weak target below 10 HP or strong defender below 40 HP
- Use Round 7 (keep Young Squire alive in critical phase)

**Mirror of Ages (Disruption):**
- Disrupts coordinated tactics, prevents flanking
- Use Round 2 (early disruption)

**Accelerate Time (Speed Boost):**
- Helps Knight stay near Apprentice, weak targets escape
- Use Round 4 (help Knight maintain Guardian's Oath)

**Causality Cascade (Damage + Consequence):**
- Punishes high-volume attackers
- Use Round 12 (endgame punishment)

**Minion Spawn (Special, Round 3 only):**
- Replaces normal lair action
- 2-3 Temporal Echoes spawn from orrery

### Escalated Versions (Round 8+)
All lair actions become significantly more powerful:
- Higher DCs (14 → 15)
- More damage (2d8 → 3d8)
- Additional effects (targets 1 → 2 creatures)
- Better healing (2d10 → 3d10+10)

**Decision Point Round 8:**
- Both weak targets alive? → **Temporal Rewind - Major Escalated** (heal both)
- One weak target dead? → **Chronal Anchor - Escalated** (control 2 PCs)

---

## Enemy Spawn and Tactics Summary

### Future Timeline Priority
1. **Ascendant:** Stay behind orrery (full cover), *slow* party, *counterspell* PC magic, *Momentary Stasis* on threats, protect Young Squire with Temporal Aegis, *disintegrate* wounded PCs
2. **Young Squire:** Rush forward *hasted*, interpose between PCs and Ascendant, use extra action for attacks, Novice's Determination when first at 0 HP
3. **Temporal Echoes:** Phase Step to backline, target squishies, Temporal Distortion when clustered, build Temporal Mimicry stacks
4. **Temporal Mote:** Stay near Ascendant, provide occasional Help action, retreat if targeted

### Past Timeline Priority
1. **Knight Prime:** Stay within 10 ft of Apprentice (Guardian's Oath), Shield Bash to push PCs away, Protective Parry (legendary) to defend Apprentice, multiattack when safe, enter Rage if Apprentice dies
2. **Apprentice:** Stay behind Knight, *hold person* on melee threats, *magic missile* for damage, *shield* reactively, *misty step* to altar if cornered, Temporal Anchor when at 0 HP

---

## Balancing on the Fly

### If PCs Struggling
- Ascendant wastes *disintegrate* on high-HP Barbarian/Fighter
- Knight uses Temporal Slash instead of Protective Parry
- Echoes don't Phase Step optimally
- Reduce lair action frequency or severity
- Temporal Mote doesn't provide Help actions

### If PCs Steamrolling
- Ascendant saves *counterspell* for healing spells specifically
- Knight grapples PCs trying to reach Apprentice
- Echoes coordinate Phase Step timing (all three same turn)
- Use escalated lair actions earlier (Round 7 instead of 8)
- Temporal Mote provides Help on Ascendant's spell attacks

### When Weak Targets Die Early

**Apprentice Dies Rounds 4-6 (Fast Kill):**
- Knight enters Rage (advantage, resistance, loses legendary actions)
- Easier Future timeline (Rounds 7-9) without Knight Prime backup
- Victory likely Round 9-10
- **Reward:** +4 Favor for breaking cycle early

**Young Squire Dies Rounds 1-3 (Fast Kill):**
- Ascendant uses Master's Will (revive at 1 HP)
- If killed again, stays dead
- Easier Past timeline (Rounds 10-12) without Young Squire
- Victory likely Round 10-11
- **Reward:** +3 Favor for exploiting inexperience

**Both Weak Targets Die Before Round 8:**
- No escalated lair actions needed
- Only strong enemies remain (enraged Knight + desperate Ascendant)
- Victory Round 9-11
- **Reward:** +5 Favor for tactical genius, Arena title "Ouroboros Breakers"
