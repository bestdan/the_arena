# Session 9 Encounter: The Chrono-boros

## Party Composition
**Party:** 5 PCs, level 5
**Expected Duration:** 10-12 rounds
**Difficulty:** Deadly (tactical puzzle with asymmetric power dynamics)

## Core Concept

Two enemies locked in a temporal ouroboros: the mighty Temporal Knight travels backward through time to protect the younger, weaker mage in the Past, while the ascended Chrono-Mage in the Future invests in and shields a young, inexperienced knight to protect him in the past. The arena shifts between two time periods every 3 rounds. The crowd watches both timelines on arcane displays, placing bets on which era falls first.

**Victory Condition:** Kill BOTH the Apprentice Mage (Past) AND the Young Knight (Future) to break the ouroboros. If either strong version survives, they resurrect their counterpart after combat ends (fight restarts after 1 minute).

---

## Timeline Rotation

The arena shifts between Past and Future every 3 rounds. Reality flickers—environments change, different enemies appear based on the active timeline.

### Timeline Shift Schedule
- **Rounds 1-3:** Future (Temporal Sanctum)
- **Rounds 4-6:** Past (Ancient Battleground)
- **Rounds 7-9:** Future (Temporal Sanctum)
- **Rounds 10-12:** Past (Ancient Battleground)
- Continue alternating if combat extends beyond Round 12

### Shift Warning
At **initiative count 12** the round BEFORE a shift, the hourglass sand accelerates visibly. The announcer shouts: "TIME SHIFTS! The [next era] approaches!"

### Positional Translation
When the timeline shifts, environmental features translate to equivalent positions:
- **Weapon rack (Past)** ↔ **Floating crystal (Future)** — corner positions
- **Bloodstained altar (Past)** ↔ **Central orrery (Future)** — central cover
- **War banner pole (Past)** ↔ **Temporal mirror (Future)** — wall positions
- **Ancient brazier (Past)** ↔ **Arcane circle (Future)** — tactical zones

PCs and enemies remain in roughly the same positions, but the environment around them changes.

## Arena Environments

### Temporal Sanctum - The Future (Rounds 1-3, 7-9, 13-15)

**"Gleaming arcane chamber where the Mage achieved temporal mastery"**

The destination timeline for the Mage—his power is strongest here.

**Terrain:**
- Smooth crystal floors (normal movement, pristine footing)
- Well-lit, arcane energy provides bright illumination

**Environmental Features:**

**Floating Crystals (6 total):**
- Levitating temporal crystals orbiting chamber at 10 feet height
- Positioned at corners and mid-walls (60 feet apart)
- **AC 15, 20 HP each**
- **Destruction:** When destroyed, explodes for 2d8 force damage in 10-foot radius (DC 14 Dex save for half)
- Can be targeted to create area denial or damage clustered enemies

**Arcane Circles (3 total):**
- Glowing ritual circles etched into floor
- 15-foot diameter each, positioned at north, south, and center
- **Standing in circle:** Advantage on saves vs. time magic, disadvantage on weapon attacks
- Tactical trade-off for spellcasters vs. martials

**Temporal Mirrors (4 total):**
- Standing mirrors along walls, 15 feet tall
- Can be shattered to create difficult terrain (5-foot square)
- Can potentially reflect spell effects with clever positioning (GM discretion)
- Positioned at cardinal directions (N, S, E, W walls)

**Central Orrery:**
- Massive clockwork device in center of arena
- 20 feet across, constantly rotating
- **Provides full cover** when positioned behind it
- **Sabotage:** DC 15 Arcana check (action) to impose disadvantage on mage's concentration checks for 1 minute
- Chrono-Mage Ascendant uses this as primary defensive position

---

### Ancient Battleground - The Past (Rounds 4-6, 10-12, 16-18)

**"War-torn battlefield where the Knight earned his legend"**

The origin timeline for the Knight—his power is strongest here.

**Terrain:**
- Blood-stained cobblestones (normal movement)
- Cracked and broken in places (scattered 5-foot difficult terrain patches)
- Dim lighting from dying braziers

**Environmental Features:**

**Weapon Racks (4 total):**
- Old weapon racks at corners of arena
- Contain rusted longswords, spears, shields
- Can be grabbed as improvised weapons (1d6 damage)
- Can be toppled for half-cover (action, creates 5-foot barrier)

**Ancient Braziers (2 total):**
- Iron braziers with dying embers, positioned north and south
- **Bonus action to stoke:** Creates 10-foot bright light, 10-foot additional dim light
- **Action to tip:** 2d6 fire damage in 10-foot cone (DC 13 Dex save for half)
- Can be used for tactical area control

**Bloodstained Altar:**
- Central stone altar covered in old battle scars
- 10 feet × 5 feet, 4 feet tall
- **Provides full cover** when positioned behind it
- Temporal Knight Prime uses this for Last Stand positioning

**War Banners (4 total):**
- Tattered banners hanging from 15-foot poles along walls
- Positioned at cardinal directions
- No mechanical effect, but provide atmospheric detail
- Can be torn down for minor cover (half-cover)

---

## Temporal Ouroboros Mechanic

**"Two warriors, each strong in their own time, each protecting the other's weakness."**

### Core Design

**Two Enemies, Two Timelines:**
- The Temporal Knight and Chrono-Mage each exist in BOTH timelines
- Vastly different power levels in each timeline
- **Four separate entities:** Past Knight, Future Knight, Past Mage, Future Mage
- Each has its own HP pool (track separately)

**Timeline-Locked:**
- Each version only appears and acts when its timeline is active
- When timeline shifts, active enemies vanish and new enemies appear
- HP persists when entities reappear in later rounds

**Asymmetric Power:**
- **Past (Ancient Battleground):**
  - Temporal Knight Prime (CR 5) - Strong, legendary warrior
  - Chrono-Mage Apprentice (CR 2) - Weak, young apprentice
- **Future (Temporal Sanctum):**
  - Chrono-Mage Ascendant (CR 9) - Strong, master wizard
  - Temporal Knight - Young Squire (CR 2) - Weak, inexperienced fighter

**Protective Synergy:**
- The strong version actively defends the weak version in its timeline
- Past: Knight Prime protects Apprentice with legendary actions and positioning
- Future: Ascendant enhances and shields Young Squire with magic

### Strategic Implications

**Party Strategy:**
- **Past rounds:** Focus fire the weak Apprentice Mage while bypassing/controlling strong Knight
- **Future rounds:** Focus fire the weak Young Squire while bypassing/controlling strong Ascendant
- **Resource management:** Spending resources on strong defenders means fewer resources for weak targets
- **Coordination:** Some PCs hold off strong enemy, others burst down weak enemy
- **Victory condition:** Kill BOTH weak versions to break the ouroboros

**If Only One Weak Target Dies:**
- Remaining strong version fights desperately to prevent paradox
- After combat ends (if strong version survives), they resurrect counterpart
- Fight restarts after 1 minute
- Party must kill BOTH weak versions

## Temporal Echoes (Minions)

**Spawn:** Round 3, Initiative Count 20 (during Future timeline)

Displaced versions of party members pulled from alternate timelines. Spectral, hostile, deeply unsettling—PCs see their own faces twisted with different experiences.

### Temporal Echo Statblock (CR 2 each)

**Number:** 2-3 spawn (use 2 for standard difficulty, 3 if PCs dominating)

**Stats:**
- **HP:** 27 each (4d8+8)

- **Speed:** 30 ft., can move through difficult terrain without penalty (phase through obstacles)
- **Initiative:** +3

**Saves:**
- DEX +5, WIS +3

- Stealth +5, Perception +3

**Damage Resistances:** Force damage (temporal beings)

**Condition Immunities:** Charmed, frightened (not fully real)

**Attacks:**
- **Multiattack:** Makes two Echo Strike attacks.
- **Echo Strike:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 1d8+3 force damage. Ghostly weapons that phase through armor.
- **Temporal Distortion (Recharge 5-6):** 15-foot cone of temporal chaos. DC 13 Wisdom save or stunned until end of Echo's next turn. Overwhelming déjà vu and paradox.

**Special Abilities:**

**Phase Step (Bonus Action):**
- Teleport up to 15 feet to unoccupied space within line of sight
- Does not provoke opportunity attacks
- Echo briefly flickers out of existence and reappears

**Temporal Mimicry:**
- When Echo hits creature with attack, learns that creature's fighting style
- Gains cumulative +1 bonus to hit against that specific creature (maximum +3)
- Represents Echo adapting to target's patterns

### Spawn Event (Round 3, Initiative Count 20)

**Location:** Round 3 of Future timeline, at Initiative Count 20 (replaces normal lair action)

**Emergence:** Central orrery violently spins and pulses. From its swirling mechanisms, 2-3 Temporal Echoes emerge.

**Announcer:** "From timelines UNMADE, your own ECHOES emerge! The arena summons what you MIGHT have BEEN! Face YOURSELVES!"

**Spawn Positions:** Echoes appear within 10 feet of orrery (center), then immediately use Phase Step to reach backline casters/ranged.

**Persistence:** Since spawning happens Round 3, Echoes will be present during Rounds 4-6 (Past timeline) as well, continuing to harass party.

### Tactical Usage

**Primary Targets:** Backline squishies (Ranger, Cleric, Wizard, Sorcerer, Warlock)

**Coordination:** Time spawn with Ascendant's *Slow* spell
- Ascendant slows frontline PCs (Round 1-2)
- Echoes spawn Round 3, Phase Step to backline
- Catches party in pincer (controlled frontline, assaulted backline)

**Temporal Distortion Priority:** Save for when backline clusters or when Cleric attempts big healing spell. Stunning the healer prevents healing for full round.

**Survivability:** 27 HP means focused fire kills them in 1-2 rounds. Echoes know this—use Phase Step aggressively to avoid being pinned down.

**Temporal Mimicry:** Focus attacks on same target repeatedly to stack bonuses. After 2-3 hits, Echo has +2 or +3 to hit that specific PC.

### Flavor and Roleplay

**Appearance:** Echoes have PCs' faces but "wrong"—different scars, different expressions, different equipment. Maybe one wears merchant's clothes (that timeline's version never became an adventurer). Another has ritualistic tattoos (became cultist instead).

**Combat Dialogue:**
- "I was you... until the arena took everything..."
- "We could have been the same..."
- "Why did you choose THIS path?"

**Death:** "The alternate timeline COLLAPSES! That future NEVER was!" Echo dissolves into temporal particles.

---

**2. Chronal Anchor (Control)**

- DC 14 Wisdom save or become "time-locked" until end of their next turn: speed 0, no reactions, disadvantage on attacks

- **Tactical:** Lock down high-damage dealers, prevent healing

**3. Temporal Rewind - Minor (Healing)**
- Choose one enemy in current timeline
- That enemy regains 2d10 HP

- **Tactical:** Disrupts coordinated tactics

**5. Accelerate Time (Speed Boost)**
- All enemies in current timeline gain +10 feet movement and can Dash as bonus action until next lair action
- **Flavor:** "Time SURGES forward! They move like LIGHTNING!"
- **Tactical:** Helps weak targets escape focus fire

**6. Causality Cascade (Damage + Consequence)**
- All creatures who dealt damage since last lair action take 1d8 force damage per attack that hit (no save)
