# Session 9 Setup: The Chrono-boros

### 3 Days After Session 8

You've proven yourselves time and again. The crowd knows your names. Your reputation grows.

[[../../npcs/Snak|Snak]] arrives with an unusual scroll case—ancient, inscribed with temporal runes.

> "Alright, champions. The Grand Master's pulling out something rare for you. Expensive magic. Temporal combat."

She unrolls the scroll, showing two overlapping arenas.

> "Ever heard of a temporal ouroboros? No? It's a time loop—a paradox where past and future protect each other. Two warriors locked in this cycle: a legendary knight from the past, and a master mage from the future. Each protects their younger self in the opposite timeline."

She taps the scroll.

> "You'll fight in two arenas that shift back and forth. The arena transforms every three rounds—past becomes future, future becomes past. The environment changes completely, and different versions of your enemies appear."

Her expression grows serious.

> "In the PAST, you face a legendary knight in his prime protecting a weak apprentice mage. The knight is powerful—plate armor, multiattack, legendary actions when defending his younger self. The apprentice is vulnerable—low HP, basic spells, relies completely on the knight."

> "In the FUTURE, you face that same apprentice after he's achieved mastery, now a powerful chronomancer. He protects a young, inexperienced knight—the past version of the legendary warrior. The mage has time magic—*slow*, *counterspell*, *disintegrate*. The young knight is enhanced by the mage's *haste* but still just learning."

She points to the victory condition.

> "Here's the trick: you have to kill BOTH weak versions—the apprentice in the past AND the young knight in the future. Kill just one and the strong survivor resurrects them after the fight ends. Break both links in the cycle or you'll be fighting them again."

She rolls up the scroll.

> "The crowd's calling it the Chrono-boros. Past and future colliding. There's even a third element—alternate-timeline versions of yourselves spawn mid-fight. Echoes from timelines where you never made it this far. They'll harass you while you deal with the main threats."

> "Intel costs the usual. 50 gold for the full tactical breakdown. Your call. But I'll say this—this one's a puzzle. You can't just hit things until they die. You need to think about which timeline to prioritize, how to bypass the strong defenders, when to shift focus."

### The Night Before the Match

If you paid for intel, Snak returns with detailed notes.

> "Right. Chrono-boros tactical breakdown."

> "Five of you, level 5. You're facing effectively four enemies—each warrior exists in both timelines with their own HP pool. Past Knight, Future Knight, Past Mage, Future Mage. Plus minions that spawn mid-fight."

She spreads out her notes.

> "**Timeline rotation:** Every three rounds, the arena shifts. You start in the FUTURE—gleaming crystal sanctum. Round 4 shifts to PAST—war-torn ancient battleground. Round 7 back to FUTURE. Keeps alternating. You'll know it's coming—hourglass above arena speeds up, announcer warns you one round before shift."

> "**Future Timeline—Temporal Sanctum:** Smooth crystal floors, floating temporal crystals orbiting at 10 feet height, central clockwork orrery, arcane circles on floor, temporal mirrors on walls. The crystals can be destroyed—AC 15, 20 HP, explode for 2d8 force in 10-foot radius. The orrery provides full cover—the mage hides behind it. The circles give advantage on saves against time magic but disadvantage on weapon attacks—good for casters, bad for warriors."

> "**Past Timeline—Ancient Battleground:** Blood-stained cobblestones, weapon racks at corners, ancient braziers with dying embers, central stone altar, war banners on walls. The braziers can be tipped for 2d6 fire damage in a cone. The altar provides full cover—the knight uses it for last stands."

She flips to enemy stats.

> "**Future enemies—Rounds 1-3, 7-9, etc.:**"

> "**Chrono-Mage Ascendant:** The big threat. 78 HP, AC 16, master wizard. Opens with *slow*—DC 17 Wisdom save, targets 4-5 of you. That's HARD. Expect 2-3 to fail. *Slow* is brutal: speed halved, -2 AC and Dex saves, can't use reactions or bonus actions. He also has *counterspell*, *Momentary Stasis* to incapacitate someone, *dimension door* to escape, and *disintegrate* for execution. Stays behind the orrery for full cover. Has a familiar—a temporal mote that hovers nearby, occasionally helps him. It's weak, 5 HP, mostly atmospheric."

> "**Young Squire:** The weak link. 55 HP, AC 16, inexperienced fighter. Enhanced by the mage's *haste*—AC 18, extra attack per turn, 40-foot speed. Rushes forward enthusiastically but fights predictably. If you reduce him to 0 HP, he can make a DC 12 Con save to drop to 1 HP instead—once. If he actually dies, the mage can revive him as a reaction—once. So you might have to 'kill' him twice."

> "**Temporal Echoes:** Round 3, 2-3 minions spawn from the orrery. They're alternate-timeline versions of you—27 HP each, AC 14, teleport 15 feet as bonus action, make two attacks for 1d8+3 force each. They build up bonuses against whoever they focus—cumulative +1 per hit, max +3. They also have a stun cone—DC 13 Wis save, 15-foot cone. They'll Phase Step to your backline immediately. Kill them fast before they stack bonuses."

> "**Past enemies—Rounds 4-6, 10-12, etc.:**"

> "**Temporal Knight Prime:** The legendary warrior. 112 HP, AC 18—AC 20 when within 10 feet of the apprentice. Plate armor, shield. Multiattack—three longsword attacks per turn at +7, each dealing 1d8+4 slashing plus 1d6 force. He also has legendary actions—3 per round—can impose disadvantage on attacks against the apprentice, move toward apprentice without provoking, or make an extra attack. If the apprentice dies and he can't save him, he enters RAGE—advantage on all attacks, resistance to all damage, but loses legendary actions."

> "**Chrono-Mage Apprentice:** The weak link. 35 HP, AC 15 with *mage armor*. Young, learning, vulnerable. Has *hold person* (DC 13 Wis save), *magic missile* for damage, *shield* reaction for +5 AC, *misty step* to escape. Stays behind the knight constantly. If reduced to 0 HP, he freezes in time for 1 round—the knight can reach him and stabilize at 1 HP. If the knight doesn't reach him in time, he dies."

She taps the victory condition.

> "**Kill both weak versions.** Apprentice in Past. Young Knight in Future. If you only kill one, the strong survivor brings them back after the fight. You have to break the entire cycle."

> "**Lair actions:** At initiative count 20 every round, the arena does something. Temporal Fracture—area damage and push. Chronal Anchor—locks someone in time, speed 0, no reactions. Temporal Rewind—heals enemies. Mirror of Ages—messes with your coordination. Accelerate Time—speeds up enemies. Causality Cascade—punishes you for attacking a lot. Round 8 onward, these get stronger—more damage, higher DCs, better effects."

She looks at each of you.

> "**Strategy suggestions:** Start in Future—focus Young Squire while managing Ascendant's control magic. He'll *slow* most of you Round 1. Stand in arcane circles if you're making saves against his magic—advantage helps. Don't waste resources on the Ascendant unless you can burst him—he's not the win condition. Kill Young Squire by Round 6 if possible."

> "When timeline shifts to Past, focus Apprentice. The Knight Prime will defend him with everything—legendary actions, positioning, shield bashes. You need to bypass, grapple, or crowd-control the knight while others kill the apprentice. Don't try to outdamage the knight—112 HP and AC 20 is a waste of time. Kill the apprentice and move on."

> "Temporal Echoes spawn Round 3—they'll teleport to your backline. Kill them fast before they stack bonuses on someone. 27 HP means focused fire drops them in 1-2 rounds."

> "Environmental: Destroy floating crystals near Ascendant to hit him with explosions. Tip braziers on clustered enemies in Past. Use orrery and altar for cover—they provide full cover. Sabotage the orrery with a DC 15 Arcana check to give the Ascendant disadvantage on concentration."

> "Timeline shifts: You'll get one round warning before shift. Use that time to burst down weak targets. Don't get caught mid-damage-race when the timeline shifts—damage persists, but your target might vanish for 3 rounds."

She closes her notes.

> "This one rewards thinking over brute force. Strong enemies are obstacles, not victory conditions. Weak enemies are the goal. Coordinate, focus fire, and break both links in the ouroboros before they can resurrect each other."

> "Want gear? Shop's open. And talk through your strategy—this puzzle requires coordination."

### As You Walk Into the Arena

The gates open to reveal a gleaming chamber unlike any arena floor you've seen before. The usual packed-dirt battlefield has been replaced by smooth crystal floors that shimmer with temporal energy. Six massive crystals orbit the chamber at head height, pulsing with inner light. Arcane circles glow on the floor, and tall mirrors line the walls, reflecting your images with strange temporal delays—you see yourselves moving a second behind or ahead.

At the center stands a massive clockwork orrery, gears spinning and clicking, tracking the movements of celestial bodies—or perhaps timelines. Behind it, partially obscured, you glimpse a robed figure: the Chrono-Mage Ascendant. Beside him hovers a small sphere of compressed time, flickering between states—his familiar, the Temporal Mote.

In front of the mage stands a young knight in chain mail, shield raised, eager but clearly inexperienced. The Young Squire shifts his weight nervously, gripping his longsword.

Above the arena, two massive hourglasses hang suspended in mid-air. One glows with bright light—sand flowing through it rapidly. The other is dim, dormant. A visual indicator of which timeline is active.

The arena chronomancer—a thin figure in elaborate robes—raises their hands. Reality ripples. For a brief moment, you see a second arena overlaid on this one: a war-torn ancient battleground with blood-stained cobblestones, rusted weapon racks, and a massive stone altar. A legendary knight in full plate armor stands protectively before a young apprentice mage in simple robes. Then the vision fades, returning to the crystal sanctum.

The announcer's voice echoes across the arena:

```
"CITIZENS OF TARSUS! Today we witness a SPECTACLE of TEMPORAL MASTERY!"

[The crowd erupts with anticipation]

"THE CHRONO-BOROS! An OUROBOROS of TIME ITSELF!"

[The hourglasses pulse, the active one glowing brighter]

"Behold TWO WARRIORS—each POWERFUL in their own era! Each PROTECTING their younger self!"

[Reality flickers, showing both timelines briefly]

"In the PAST, the legendary KNIGHT in his prime shields the apprentice mage! In the FUTURE, the ascended CHRONOMANCER protects his young, untested knight!"

[The orrery spins faster, temporal energy crackling]

"An ETERNAL CYCLE of guardianship! Past guards future! Future invests in past! The snake devours its own tail!"

[The Ascendant raises a hand, temporal magic swirling]

"The arena will SHIFT between eras every three rounds! PAST and FUTURE collide! The ENVIRONMENT transforms! Different warriors emerge from the timestream!"

[The hourglass glows intensely]

"Can they break the LOOP? Can they sever BOTH links in the temporal chain? Kill the apprentice mage in the PAST! Kill the young knight in the FUTURE! Break the OUROBOROS or face them AGAIN!"

[The Young Squire grips his sword, enhanced by temporal magic]

"But beware! From timelines UNMADE, their own ECHOES will emerge! Alternate versions of themselves—what they MIGHT have BEEN!"

[The crowd roars, temporal energy building]

"FIVE GLADIATORS against the PARADOX OF TIME ITSELF! Will tactical BRILLIANCE break the cycle? Or will the ouroboros prove ETERNAL?"

[The orrery reaches a crescendo, gears clicking into place]

"Timeline: FUTURE! The ascended mage has achieved MASTERY! The young knight fights to prove himself! Three rounds until the SHIFT!"

[The Temporal Mote emits a high-pitched whine, the Ascendant begins weaving spell components]

"Let the CHRONO-BOROS BEGIN!"

[Horn blast. Roll initiative.]
```

The crystal chamber hums with power. The Ascendant's hands glow with arcane energy. The Young Squire charges forward, eager and enhanced. The Temporal Mote flickers between past, present, and future states.

The temporal battle begins.

- Bypass strong defenders with control, grapple, or forced movement
- Temporal Echoes are high priority—kill before they teleport freely

Good luck, champions. May you break the ouroboros.
