## Notes from the encounter
- Father Crow wiffs on two Guiding Bolts
- But Orion manages to nerf the Ogre repeatedly with Hideous Laughter and Vicious Mockery - unexpected! 
- Imwe puts Lira up on his shoulders, she promptly gets a crossbow bolt to the shoulder
- Gladiator narrowly saves Lira
- Merryn is taken out by Hyenas and Thugs
- Torgana mugs for the crowd, using `light in their eyes`, and then still takes a bolt to the dome
- Father Crow and Torgana gangu up on the poor Ogre, much Panache with Advantage is had
- Imwe smashes two hyenas into the spikes, much appreciation from the crowd
- Tovo is killed by a hyena and Thug combo
- The party is saved by the bell as six rounds of combat close

The motley crew survive....

## Post-game outcomes
- Snak takes back the shield and tells Gladiator 'not bad'
- Snak is impressed... and appreciative. She finds them armor and weapons for their liking.
- She gets the kids (Dec and Lira at least) out the next day. Rohm stays, but is transferred to another Pen.
- There is suspicion about how well the gladiators did... Y'all ruined someones plan.

## The Aftermath

The gates close behind you. The roar of the crowd fades to a dull rumble through stone walls. Sand still clings to your weapons, darkened with blood that isn't all yours.

Snak is waiting in the undercroft, arms crossed. Her eyes sweep over the survivors—counting bodies, tallying costs. When she reaches Gladiator, she holds out her hand. He returns the shield without a word. She wipes the worst of the gore off with her sleeve, then grunts. "Not bad."

The silence stretches. Then she adds, quieter: "Better than not bad. Two out of three is more than I expected." She jerks her chin toward Dec and Lira, who huddle together against the far wall, eyes still wide with the shock of survival. "I'll have them out by dawn. They won't be on this side of arena walls again. Clean papers, a new life."

Rohm stands apart, stone-faced. Blood seeps through a makeshift bandage on his shoulder, but he doesn't seem to notice. His eyes are fixed on the two body-shaped bundles being dragged past on stretchers. Tovo. Merryn.

She looks at Rohm: "He'll be taken out of the pens for a bit. There's been an inquest about how the kids got in here. Called witnesses that show up dead are frowned on."

Rohm finally looks at Snak, then at each of you in turn. No words. Just a single, slow nod—the kind that carries weight. A debt acknowledged. 

Snak turns back to the party. "Someone upstairs is pissed. You weren't supposed to win that clean. Wasn't supposed to be a _show_." She spits to the side. "So keep your heads down tonight. And if anyone asks? You got lucky."

She walks away, then stops at the door. Without turning: "There's new gear in your quarters. Good stuff. You earned it."

The door clangs shut.

You're left with the sound of your own breathing, the distant chants still echoing from above, and the knowledge that you just painted a target on your backs by refusing to die on schedule.
