## 5 days before Match 3: 

The half-elf woman recovers. Her name is [Merryn Thal](../../npcs/merryn.md).  She joined The Arena voluntarily. She **loves** fame, the crowd, the applause. She did something else before (she won't reveal what), but failed at it, and this seemed like the natural next step. She's as cutthroat as can be: make her look good, she'll help you. Make her look bad, you'll end up like those shitty archers. 
She's good with a bow, and meditates by sharpening a pair of long curved daggers. She's somehow already gotten new clothes in the pens, some brightly colored scarves.

## 2 days before Match 3: 
Snak saunters to your boarding room. She looks your party over with a flat, unimpressed stare, chewing on something that might be jerky or might be a warning.


> Good news, bad news. You're doing the Butchers Block in two days. *Big* step up. No mindless beasts this time—real fighters who know what they're doing. Who _like_ it. I hope you figured out how to fight together, because corpses don't earn coin. Not for you, not for me. 

[She crosses her arms, irritation clear in her voice] 
> Better time slot, bigger crowd. More eyes on you. Problem is, the scouts coming are bottom-feeders. Local handlers, petty patrons, folks betting on cheap blood instead of investing in talent. Not the caliber you need. 

[She leans in, lowering her voice but not hiding her annoyance] 

> You want real backing? Real money? Then you give them a show they can't ignore. Make enough noise that the people behind those scouts start asking questions. Make yourselves worth the investment. 

[She straightens up, cracks her neck] 
> So don't die stupid. Hit hard, last long, make 'em wish they'd sent someone who matters. Dead fighters don't generate revenue.

## 1 day before Match 3:
At about 1pm, after lunch, you hear heavy boots in the hallway. Jeff's voice, sharp. Then another voice: "Hey, lay off, he's exhausted." The lock rattles. Jeff appears, face already annoyed, and shoves the door open.

First through is a young man, barely. Maybe 18 years old. Lanky, with dirt under his fingernails and the hollow-eyed look of someone who hasn't slept in days. He can barely stand.

Second is a girl. Maybe 16, with her dark hair matted and tangled. She'd look terrified but she doesn't have enough energy for that.

Third is another boy, say 17. He walks with a pronounced limp, favoring his left leg. As he comes to the doorway, he isn't moving fast enough. Jeff raises his arm to cuff him in the back of the head.

Out of the other side of the door flies a head, connecting with Jeff's nose. Jeff stumbles back, and a leg pistons out into Jeff's chest. Jeff rockets down the hall.

A man calmly walks into the cell behind the three kids. He's solid looking, thick legs, shoulder length black hair, and eyes like stones at the bottom of a cold river. The kids' hands are free. His are manacled.

He slides the cell door closed behind him and stands inside, facing Jeff as Jeff staggers to his feet and locks the cell. Jeff spits blood. "You're fucking dead tomorrow, all of you." His voice cracks slightly. He leaves quickly.

The man turns to the cell, directly meeting each of your gazes. Lastly resting on Torgana—the largest, most seemingly dangerous—he says "Any harm that comes to any of them will be repaid double." You do not doubt his resolve.

He goes and sits with the others. The girl curls up under his arm. The younger boy leans back on the wall next to him. The older boy—Tovo—says "Sleep Rohm. I'll keep watch." The man grunts as if he doesn't believe him, yet is snoring in minutes.

A long silence. Then Tovo speaks quietly: "He'd do it too. He killed 12 of them before they took him down."

He pauses, staring at the opposite wall.

"They got lucky. His horse broke its ankle."

Over the next hour, you learn their names:  Rohm, Tovo Dec and Lira. They're from the east. A horse-herding people in the steppes. Not really rich enough to be a target for the Empire, but their resistance is annoying and a bad example. They're prisoners of war. Their families are dead. Finally, Tovo falls sleep too.  

## Morning of the match
Snak comes to the room door. Her face is a storm of anger. She quietly motions for you to join her. Even Merryn gets up. 
"Not you elf, you want no part of this, I know." Merryn waves dismissingly, goes back to stretching. 


> "This is fucking bullshit. They’re way too green. The moment they get out there it will be clear. And if they die in the first bout, the crowd blames _me_. Somethings up. Near as I can figure, someone wants the kids dead so that the big bastard can move up and fight higher. And I'm supposed to take the hit of three corpses that never stood a chance. 

> Fuck that. Keep ’em alive through today, i can move them out of the pens tomorrow after the match. I'll make it worth your while."
She thinks, chewing on her nails. 

> "Motivation ain't gonna be enough though, not with those three walking dead in there. Time to call in a favor. Meet me at the armory early tomorrow, about an hour before match."


## An hour before match, the Armory
Snak is there waiting when you enter. 
> "Yeah, it's bullshit. Nothing worth me losing points over. So."

 Her eyes cruise over Torgana, Imwe, landing on Gladiator. 

> "Time to even the odds a bit."
She pulls a shield out of a burlap sack. It's covered in grime and mud. Intentionally. To hide something about it. 

> "You seemed handy with **a shield**. Hope I'm not wrong. You've got an hour to get used to it. Don't fuck it up. Try to not let anyone on that it's special."

She hands the shield to Gladiator.

> If he dies, I'll reward whoever lives if you bring that shield back. 


## Ten minutes before match, the Armory
Rohm, Tovo, Dec and Lira enter. They look surprisingly better, sharp eyed. They glance at you, then move to the weapons. Lira picks up two daggers, flips them. The two boys pick up spears, obviously quite comfortable with them. THey are resolved. And resigned.

Rohm goes directly for the shields, and a spear, does a quick calibration of weight and length. 
He looks over you all, eyes lingering on Gladiators shield. 

> "Dirty. But no less effective. I have nothing to offer except my future debt, and the hope you are a good man.  Help me. Help them. You can have my winnings, and my favor."

The bugle sounds. The announcer begins. 


## Arena Intro

**[The crowd noise is louder this time — maybe 150 people. The sun is high and hot. Trumpets sound, sharper than before.]**

> "LADIES and GENTLEMEN! Welcome back to the Arena of Tarsus, where yesterday's survivors become today's entertainment!"

> "Last week, we saw this fresh blood face fang and scale. They survived... but surviving is just the _start_ of the story"

> "Today? Today we separate the _lucky_ from the _lethal_."

> "No more beasts driven mad with hot irons. No more mindless claws and hunger. Today, our survivors face something _far_ more dangerous…"

> "_Professionals._"

> "That's right! From the holding pens of the east gate, we present: THE BUTCHER'S BLOCK!"

```
 
The bugle sounds. You walk up into the blinding light once again. To an arena very different to the one you left. 


Roll initiative please. 

There is silence, the the crowd gasps as they see the kids. There are murmers and less cheering. For all it's cruelty, The Arena doesn't enjoy seeing kids slaughtered.
