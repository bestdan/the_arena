Logically, it makes sense that there was a time before the empire. But within Tarsus there are no histories, not stories, of anything before. The Empire has been around a long time. The empire has simply always been a fact of life, like the bite of cold and the bright of sun.

It is not ossified or rotting - it is living and dynamic. Fortunes are made and lost. Political careers rise and fall, culture and fads and fashions come and go.

It grows it's frontiers constantly. It's growth is not cancerous. It is measured, steady, thoughtful. It never overreaches. It starts with diplomacy, then cajoling and then (if necessary) there's always an either an oppressed people needing to be freed, or preemptive defense from a enemy plotting. Eventually all are consumed. It is a stately consumption.

The empire builds roads roads that stretch from one end to the other, bringing far-flung people together as well as their goods, their customs, their music, their food. But not their histories.

An you can buy everything in Tarsus. The heart of the Empire. It is where the Senate sits is where the wealthiest families hold their estates. It has theaters and universities and guilds and organized crime (of course).

Tarsus is every other organ as well. The spleen and the liver cleaning out the detritus all of those veins that bring all the good things. Because they also bring the bad - every criminal, every traitor, every prisoner of war from the far-flung armies who would not bend the knee .... They all make their way into Tarsus to the Arena.

The Arena is huge, the largest structure in Tarsus. It is not just a stadium. It is a theater. What happens here is not just battle. It has been refined to an art of drama, and plot arcs, and betrayal and even love occasionally. And speaking of refinement the arena is a refinery.

The arena takes, and from each batch refines a minute percentage into a hero. Surviving is not enough to make it. You must have supporters and fans. Most who make it have patrons and benefactors who have bet on their heroes, and made shared in the gains and losses from their fate. You must make yourself too valuable to kill. And for those that do, there is a rich, exciting, comfortable and august life on the other side.

It's not only the unwilling who enter. Some are driven by poverty (the participants do get food and lodging and clothes after all). Some simply enjoy the violence. Others just find they are very good at it, and the Arena is a good living. Some have ambition and a taste for celebrity. People from all over, with very different motivations.

In a holding pen are twenty people new participants. Some obviously know each other, others are stranger to all. There are some who are desolate. There are some brimming with excitement.

This is a mid weekday performance. You are no draw, but time is money and matinees still bring in a few onlookers.

A gruff looking orc woman arms bearing a leather armor vest comes enters the room. She hooks her fingers into the vest looks around at you and smiles.

     Welcome. My name is Snak. I'm here to give you the best chance possible. Which isn't great, but the dead don't pay partials. Looks like some of you already know each other, fair enough. For the rest, if you survive the next half hour, I'll learn your name. For now, you'll be going up against animals, so pick your equipment accordingly.

In the next hall are weapons and equipment of all sorts. All of it well made, none of it remarkable.

At the end of the hall is a portculis. Pick your weapons. We start in 5 minutes.

This is a d&d "core rules" campaign that i am running. The general theme is for them to be combatants in an arena where they have to face new and harder challenges every week while having a hunger games style escalation and support from outside benefactors.
