# Session 5 Encounter: Hide and Seek

## The Nighttime Hunt

**Party:** 5 PCs, level 3 (3 Phoenix-Blessed survivors + 2 new gladiators)
**Objective:** Survive 10 rounds without being "announced" by hunters
**Expected Outcome:** High-tension survival challenge; some PCs may be announced and must make critical saves

---

## Arena Layout

Sprawling nighttime arena (120x120 feet) lit only by four **Announcement Pillars** and ambient moonlight.

### Key Features

**Four Announcement Pillars** (North, South, East, West)
- Stone obelisks, 15 feet tall, glowing faintly blue
- Located 30 feet from center, evenly spaced at cardinal directions
- AC 17, 75 HP each
- Immune to poison and psychic damage
- Can be destroyed to eliminate announcement sites
- **Destruction causes explosion:** 20-foot radius, 3d8 force damage, Dex save DC 14 for half

**The Hourglass of Dread** (center of arena)
- Massive magical timer, 20-foot diameter area
- Counts down 10 rounds visibly
- Floats 5 feet off ground, sheds dim light in 10-foot radius
- Cannot be destroyed or moved

**Terrain Elements:**
- **Stone Blocks:** Scattered throughout (5-10 feet tall, full cover)
- **Canvas Awnings:** Half cover, can be collapsed with DC 12 Strength check
- **Sand Dunes:** Difficult terrain, shift 10 feet in random direction each round
- **Lighting:** Dim light beyond 60 feet (lightly obscured); pillars and hourglass provide focal light

### Environmental Rules
- **Visibility:** Dim light creates lightly obscured conditions beyond 60 feet
- **Stealth Advantage:** Creatures with darkvision have advantage on Perception in dim light
- **Shifting Terrain:** At initiative count 20 each round, 1d3 sand dunes shift position

## Core Mechanic: Announcement Pillars

### How Announcing Works

**To Announce a PC, a hunter must:**
1. Be **adjacent to an Announcement Pillar** (within 5 feet)
2. Use an **action**
3. **Know the PC's name** (first name or commonly used name)
4. Have **seen the PC within the last 3 rounds** (line of sight, within 60 feet)

### Announcement Effect

When a PC is announced:
1. PC's name **booms across the arena** (no save, everyone hears it)
2. At the **start of PC's next turn**, they must make **Wisdom save DC 15**
3. **Failure:** PC drops to 0 HP instantly (crowd's magic strikes them down)
4. **Success:** PC takes 4d10 force damage and is **marked** (glows faintly, disadvantage on Stealth for 1 minute)

### Preventing Announcements

**PCs can:**
- Destroy pillars (eliminates announcement sites but causes noise/attention)
- Grapple, shove, stun, or kill hunters before they reach pillars
- Use *silence*, *darkness*, or magical obscurement
- Hide effectively so hunters don't "see them within 3 rounds"
- Stay mobile—break line of sight frequently
- Use false names or avoid speaking names aloud

---

## Enemies: The Hunters

Hunters are trained assassins who **prioritize reaching pillars over direct combat**. They'll disengage and dash to announce rather than fight to the death.

### 5 PC Party Composition

**4 Shadow Stalkers**
- Use **Assassin** stat block (CR 8), modified:
  - **HP:** 60 (reduced from 78)
  - **AC:** 15 (studded leather)
  - **Speed:** 35 ft
  - **Skills:** Stealth +9 (expertise)
  - **Special:** *Pass Without Trace* (cast before combat; +10 to Stealth for 1 hour)
  - **Attacks:** Shortsword +6 to hit (1d6+3 piercing + 7d6 poison on surprise)
  - **Assassinate:** Advantage on attacks vs. creatures that haven't acted; crits on surprised creatures
  - **Evasion:** Dex saves take no damage on success, half on failure

**2 Hound Masters**
- Use **Scout** stat block (CR 1/2):
  - **HP:** 16
  - **AC:** 13 (leather)
  - **Speed:** 30 ft
  - **Attacks:** Shortsword +4 to hit (1d6+2 piercing)
  - **Special:** Each commands 1 **Shadow Hound** (see below)

**2 Shadow Hounds**
- Use **Dire Wolf** stat block with modifications:
  - **HP:** 37
  - **AC:** 14
  - **Speed:** 50 ft
  - **Darkvision:** 120 ft
  - **Keen Hearing and Smell:** Advantage on Perception checks using hearing/smell
  - **Pack Tactics:** Advantage on attacks if ally within 5 ft of target
  - **Attacks:** Bite +5 to hit (2d6+3 piercing), DC 13 Strength save or knocked prone

### Hunter Tactics

**Shadow Stalkers:**
- Open combat hidden via *Pass Without Trace* (+9 Stealth becomes +19)
- Observe PCs from distance, learn names (eavesdrop on PC conversations)
- Once they have a name and recent sighting, **dash to nearest pillar**
- If attacked, use Cunning Action to **Disengage** and continue to pillar
- Only fight directly if cornered or if it creates opening for another Stalker

**Hound Masters:**
- Stay at mid-range (30-40 feet from PCs)
- Command hounds to **harry and distract** PCs
- Use hounds to track PCs by scent (advantage on Survival checks)
- Relay information to Stalkers: "Three near the east pillar!" (shouted)

**Shadow Hounds:**
- Track PCs by scent (can follow even without seeing recently)
- Use Pack Tactics to knock PCs prone, creating openings
- Distraction: draw PC attention while Stalkers move
- **Do not announce**—they're beasts, not intelligent enough

### Hunter Behavior Notes

- Hunters **do not fight to the death**
- If a pillar is destroyed, they relocate to another operational pillar
- If all four pillars are destroyed, hunters **retreat** (PCs win early)
- Stalkers coordinate via hand signals and low whistles (Perception DC 16 to notice)
- Hound Masters shout PC locations occasionally (Intel for Stalkers)

## Hazards and Twists

### Shifting Sands (Every Round)
At initiative count 20, roll 1d3. That many sand dunes move 10 feet in random directions (roll d8 for direction). Difficult terrain repositions; update map.

**Effect:** Cover and concealment shift unpredictably.

### Scrying Eyes (Every 2-3 Rounds)
Crowd watches via scrying illusions. Occasionally, announcer shouts out a PC's rough location:

> "I see you, Imwe, near the east pillar!"

**Effect:** Named PC must make **Stealth check DC 15** or hunters gain advantage to locate them next round (know their 10-foot radius area).

### Pillar Explosion (When Pillar Destroyed)
Pillar erupts in arcane energy when reduced to 0 HP.

**Effect:** 20-foot radius, 3d8 force damage, Dex save DC 14 for half. Affects PCs and hunters equally.

### Round 7 Twist: "The Hunt Intensifies!"
Announcer declares heightened danger. Roll randomly for one PC—their name is shouted loudly across arena via scrying magic.

**Effect:** All hunters know that PC's **approximate location** (10-foot radius revealed) for 1 round. PC is now priority target.

## Announcer Beats

### Opening (Dusk Falls)
```
[Darkness descends on the arena. The crowd falls silent. Scrying illusions flicker to life above the stands.]

"Citizens of Tarsus, honored guests... tonight you witness a HUNT!"

[The four pillars begin glowing brighter]

"Ten rounds. Four pillars. Hunters in the dark with NAMES as weapons!"

[The hourglass begins its countdown]

"If your name is SPOKEN at a pillar—the crowd's magic STRIKES YOU DOWN!"

[Gates open silently. Hunters slip into darkness.]

"Run. Hide. Survive. Or become... the PREY!"
```

### First Hunter Reaches Pillar (Round 2-3)
```
[Hunter grips pillar, begins speaking]

"A Stalker at the pillar! Whose name will they CRY?!"

[Tense pause as hunter speaks a name]

"THE NAME IS SPOKEN!"
```

### First Announcement Success (PC Must Save)
```
[PC's name booms across arena]

"[PC NAME]! The crowd's magic seeks you!"

[PC glows faintly, must save]

"Will they FALL?! Or RESIST?!"
```

### First Pillar Destroyed (Round 4-6)
```
[Stone shatters, explosion erupts]

"DEFIANCE! They DESTROY the pillar itself!"

"Bold! Reckless! But THREE pillars remain!"

[Crowd cheers via scrying]

"The hunters adapt! The hunt continues!"
```

### Round 7: Halfway Point
```
"SEVEN rounds remain! Halfway through the hunt!"

[Hourglass sand accelerates]

"The hunters move FASTER now! Nowhere is safe!"

```

[Arena lights rise slowly, revealing the five standing PCs]

"CHAMPIONS OF THE DARK! VICTORS OF THE HUNT!"
```

### Defeat (If PC Announced and Killed)
```
[PC drops to 0 HP from announcement]

"DOWN! [PC NAME] has FALLEN to the crowd's will!"

[Somber pause]

"The hunt is UNFORGIVING. The pillars do not LIE."

[If PC activates Last Stand]

"WAIT—THEY RISE! One final stand against the dark! DEFIANCE!"
```

## GM Tips

### Track "Seen Within 3 Rounds" Strictly
Maintain a note for each hunter indicating which PCs they've seen recently and when. This is critical for announcement validity.

**Example Tracker:**
- Stalker #1: Saw Imwe (Round 3), saw Torgana (Round 5)
- Stalker #2: Saw Father Crow (Round 4), saw Newbie A (Round 4)

Hunters **cannot announce** PCs they haven't seen within 3 rounds, even if they know the name.

### Name Discipline
If PCs shout each other's names carelessly, hunters listening nearby (Perception DC 12) learn those names.

**Track Known Names:**
- Which hunters have heard which PC names
- Encourage players to use code names, gestures, or whispers

### Hunter Priority: Pillars Over Kills
Hunters will **disengage from combat** to reach pillars if they have a name and recent sighting. They won't stand and fight unless cornered. This creates tactical dilemmas: do PCs chase to stop them, or hide to avoid being seen?

### Stealth Checks Frequently
Call for Stealth vs. Perception rolls often:
- When PCs move to new cover
- When hunters actively search an area
- When PCs try to avoid hunter patrols

Don't auto-reveal PCs—let clever positioning and terrain use shine.

### Pillar Destruction is Loud
Make it clear: destroying a pillar is **noisy, visible, and attracts attention**. All nearby hunters (within 60 feet) immediately know the pillar's location. Trade-off: safety from announcements vs. drawing hunters to you.

### Hound Tracking
Hounds can track by scent even if PCs break line of sight. This adds pressure: hiding isn't always enough if hounds are on your trail. PCs need to kill hounds or create distractions (false scents, water, etc.).

### Shifting Sands Add Chaos
Each round, move 1-3 dunes randomly. This keeps the battlefield dynamic and prevents static camping strategies. PCs must adapt their hiding spots constantly.

### Crowd Scrying Callouts
Once per 2-3 rounds, have the announcer reveal a PC's rough location (based on "scrying"). This isn't exact—give a 10-foot radius area. Creates urgency without being punishing.

### Hourglass as Visual Timer
If using VTT (Roll20, Foundry), create a countdown timer visual. In person, use a visible timer or mark rounds loudly. The countdown creates urgency and tension.

## Aftermath Seeds

### Patron Interest: Stealth Specialist
A shadowy guild master was impressed by the stealth tactics. Sends an emissary offering contract work for "discreet removals" or access to spy network.

**Reward:** 200 gp up front, future mission opportunities, potential dark patron

### Political Fallout: Pillar Destruction
If PCs destroyed pillars, the patron who sponsored them (a wealthy mage) is **furious**. Those were expensive experimental weapons. Demands compensation or future service.

**Consequence:** Debt to powerful NPC, or rival gladiators hired to "teach a lesson"

### Psychological Effect: Marked by Announcement
PC who was announced and survived (made the save) carries paranoia for 1d4 days: **disadvantage on Wisdom saves vs. fear**.

**Roleplay Hook:** Nightmares about hearing their name boom across the arena

### Permanent Mark: Failed Announcement Save
PC who failed announcement save but was revived (via *revivify* or similar) carries **Marked by the Crowd**:
- Faint permanent glow unless *dispel magic* or *greater restoration*
- Disadvantage on Stealth in dim light or darker
- Crowd recognizes them instantly (+1 Favor in future bouts, but also -1 to surprise)

**Tradeoff:** Fame vs. stealth capability

### Assassins' Guild Drama
The hunters' guild claims the hunt was rigged unfairly (pillar destruction wasn't in the contract). Demands rematch or compensation from Grand Master. Political tension, potential follow-up bout.

**Consequence:** Next session might be rematch with new rules

### Loot: Arcane Resonance Crystals
Each destroyed Announcement Pillar yields 1 **Arcane Resonance Crystal**:
- Can be attuned (requires attunement slot)
- Grants *sending* spell once per day while attuned
- Worth 150 gp if sold
- **Total Available:** 1 per pillar destroyed (max 4 if all destroyed)

---

## Scaling Options

### Too Easy?
- Add 1 more Shadow Stalker (5 total)
- Increase Stalker HP to 70 each
- Hunters gain +10 movement starting at Round 4 (instead of Round 6)
- Hounds have 50 HP instead of 37
- Scrying callouts happen every round (more frequent hunter intel)

### Too Hard?
- Reduce Shadow Stalkers to 3 total
- Lower Stalker HP to 50 each
- Remove Round 9-10 advantage on attacks/Stealth
- Give party 2 darkvision potions instead of 1
- Pillars have 60 HP instead of 75 (easier to destroy)

### Someone Being Ignored?
- Have hunters specifically target isolated PCs
- Hound Master shouts their location to Stalkers
- Create dramatic moment: "A Stalker has YOUR name, [PC]! They're moving to the pillar!"
- Use Round 7 twist to spotlight that PC

### Too Much Chaos?
- Reduce shifting sand dunes to once every 2 rounds
- Remove scrying callouts entirely (rely on hunter Perception)
- Increase "seen within 3 rounds" window to "5 rounds" (more lenient)
- Hunters only know names of Phoenix-Blessed PCs (newbies are unknown)

---

- Introduce high-stakes save-or-die mechanics (announcement)
- Make environmental interaction meaningful (pillar destruction, terrain use)
- Show that Arena combats vary wildly—prepare for anything
