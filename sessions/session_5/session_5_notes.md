## Session Objectives

### Primary Goal
Survive 10 rounds without being announced and executed by hunters.

### Secondary Goals
- Destroy Announcement Pillars (risky but effective)
- Kill hunters (at least half for bonus Favor)
- Accumulate [[crowds_favor|Crowd's Favor]] through stealth and clever tactics

---

## Key Mechanics to Track

### Announcement System
- Hunters must **see a PC within last 3 rounds** to announce them
- Hunters must **know PC's name** (from eavesdropping or prior knowledge)
- Announce requires **action while adjacent to pillar**
- Announced PC makes **Wisdom save DC 15** at start of their next turn
  - **Fail:** Drop to 0 HP instantly
  - **Success:** Take 4d10 force damage, marked (disadvantage on Stealth for 1 min)

### Hunter Vision Tracker
Track which hunters have seen which PCs and when:

| Hunter | PCs Seen (Round) | Names Known |
|--------|------------------|-------------|
| Stalker 1 | | |
| Stalker 2 | | |
| Stalker 3 | | |
| Stalker 4 | | |
| Hound Master 1 | | |
| Hound Master 2 | | |

### Round-by-Round Tracker
