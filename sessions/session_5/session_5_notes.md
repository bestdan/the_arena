# Session 5 Notes: Hide and Seek

## Critical Moments Log
Multiple times the PCs are able to slow or prevent the Hunters from using a pillar. In the last round, Torgana is named, and hit with a huge dose of necrotic energy, but as barbarian bounces back with 1HP. He is then killed again in the next round, but since it is the last round, he does not roll enough death saving throws to actually die. The mercenary heals him

Imwe with no dark vision is stuck trying to destroy a pillar. Gets close but doesn't pull it off.
