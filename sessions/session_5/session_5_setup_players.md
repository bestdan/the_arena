# Session 5 Setup: Hide and Seek Night Game

## 3 Days Before the Match*

The three survivors—[[imwe|Imwe]], [[torgana|Torgana]], and [[father_crow|Father Crow]]—sit in the recovery area. The other bunks are empty.

One new face appears in the pens. Not new to the arena, but new to you.

[Snak appears]

> “Alright, ‘Phoenix-Blessed’. Time to earn those fancy titles. You three pulled off something special—died, came back, got the crowd chanting your names. You made it out of the amateur league. Don’t get cocky.”

She gestures to the newcomer.

> "This is your new teammate for the next bout. Learn how to work together, yeah? Or don't. Natural selection works just fine too."

She tosses each of the three survivors a pouch. Theres `50GP` in each.

> “That’s from your new admirers. Temple priestess. Merchant guild. Some noble whose name I can’t pronounce. They want to see what you do NEXT. I’m guessing you’ll need it. Survival won’t be free any more.”

> “I’m hearing rumors about the next match - it’s gonna be different somehow. They’re always getting ‘creative’. I’m can try to find out what you’ll be up against, but this time it’ll cost you. I know a guy, but he don’t work for free.`25 GP`. Take it or leave it.”

> “Or, let me know if you want anything from the shop. Best prices you’ll get. (Only prices you’ll get.)”

## The Night Before The Hunt

> "Alright knob-jobs. You all should thank Bald-and-Beautiful over here - the intel is well worth the coin. 

> This one's gonna be different.  No slugfest. No beast to kill. You're the prey."

> "First off, it's a night game. If you don't see in the dark, you'll either want a torch, a good friend who does, or a prayer. The crowd can still see you - fancy scrying magic."

> "Second, it's a game of Hide and Seek. There are Naming Pillars at the four compass points in the arena. If a hunter activates the pillar and shouts your name with the memory of your face fresh, you'll be in for a ton of hurt. Seriously, you don't want to let that happen."

> "And the hunters know your game—they've watched you fight. They've heard your names. So you're at a disadvantage. Here's the trick: they have to SEE you first. Recently. Within a few rounds. So you hide, you move, you stay QUIET. Don't shout each other's names like idiots. Use signals. Gestures. Whatever."

> "If you are seen.. either kill them or slow them down before they get to a pillar."

> "Or..." She grins wider. "...you go loud. Destroy the pillars - they aren't unbreakable. Can't announce you if there's nowhere TO announce. But that's noisy work. Brings every hunter running."

> "Either way—stealth, destruction, or some brilliant combination—make it fun. The crowd's watching via scrying magic, they'll see everythign. Give them a scary show in the dark."

> "You've got some money, let me know if you want anything to help. But don't be dumb- big clanky armor ain't gonna help."

She tosses a small vial on the bunk.

> "My gift to you. Darkvision potion. One dose. Choose wisely who drinks it. Or don't—chaos is entertaining too."

## An hour before the match in the Armory

Snak walks in holding a pouch at arms length, like it's a venemous snake. She tosses it to Father Crow: 

> "Hey altar-boy - some culty weirdos just dropped this off for you. Said to get it to you ASAP."

In the pouch is an necklace with a dried eye and two dried ears on it. The ears have fur, like a wolfs. There is a scrap of paper that just says "Use me."

*As you walk into the Arena*

> "Tonight! A spectacle! HIDE AND SEEK in the dark! Hunters stalk their PREY with their NAMES on their lips. If they reach a pillar and SHOUT a name.... we'll, let's just say it may be the last time you hear it...."

> "Ten rounds. Four pillars. SURVIVE the hunt... or be forgotten!"

In the center, a massive magical hourglass floats—ten segments of sand, each representing one round.
