# Session 5 Setup: Hide and Seek Night Game

*3 Days Before the Match*

The three survivors—[[imwe|Imwe]], [[torgana|Torgana]], and [[father_crow|Father Crow]]—sit in the recovery area. Phoenix-Blessed, they're called now. Resurrected. Marked. Changed.

The others bunks are empty.

Two new faces appear in the pens. Fresh blood.

*Snak appears, coin purse heavy with new patronage money:*

> "Alright, 'Phoenix-Blessed'. Time to earn those fancy titles. You three pulled off something special—died, came back, got the crowd chanting your names. You made it out of the amateur league. Don't get cocky."

She tosses each of the three a pouch. Theres 50GP in each. 

> "That's from your new admirers. Temple priestess. Merchant guild. Some noble whose name I can't pronounce. They want to see what you do NEXT. I'm guessing you'll need it. Survival won't be free any more."

She gestures to the two newcomers.

> "These are your new teammates for the next bout. Learn how to work together, yeah? Or don't. Natural selection works too."

> "I'm hearing rumors about the next match - it's gonna be different somehow. They're always getting 'creative'. I'm gonna try to find out what you'll be up against."


*The Night Before The Hunt*

> "Alright nob-heads. This one's gonna be different.  No slugfest. No beast to kill. You're the PREY now. And you change how you play."

> "They're really stepping it up for you. First off, it's gonna be a night game - if you dont' see in the dark, you'll either want a torch, a good friend who does, or a prayer."

> "Second, it's gonna be Hide and Seek. There are Naming Pillars at the four compass points in the arena. If a hunter touches the pillar and shouts your name with the memory of your face fresh, you'll be in for a ton of hurt. Seriously, you don't want that."

> "Phoenix-touched fancy boys- the hunters know your game—they've watched you fight. They've heard your names. So you're at a disadvantage. Here's the trick: they have to SEE you first. Recently. Within a few rounds. So you hide, you move, you stay QUIET. Don't shout each other's names like idiots. Use signals. Gestures. Whatever."

> "Or..." She grins wider. "...you go loud. Destroy the pillars. Can't announce you if there's nowhere TO announce. But that's noisy work. Brings every hunter running."

> "Either way—stealth, destruction, or some brilliant combination—make it fun. The crowd's watching via scrying magic, they'll see everythign. Give them a scary show in the dark."

> "You've got some money, let me know if you want anything to help. But don't be dumb- big clanky armor ain't gonna help."

She tosses a small vial on the bunk.

> "Darkvision potion. One dose. Choose wisely who drinks it. Or don't—chaos is entertaining too."

*An hour before the match in the Armory*

Snak walks in holding a pouch at arms length, like it's a venemous snake. She tosses it to Father Crow: 

> "Hey altar-boy - some religious weirdos just dropped this off for you. Said to get it to you ASAP. Man, I flipping hate religious types, give me the heebies."

In the pouch is an necklace with a dried eye and two dried ears on it. The ears have fur, like a wolfs. There is a scrap of paper that just says "Use me."

*As you walk into the Arena*

> "Tonight! A spectacle! HIDE AND SEEK in the dark! Hunters stalk their PREY with their NAMES on their lips. If they reach a pillar and SHOUT a name.... we'll, let's just say it may be the last time you hear it...."

> "Ten rounds. Four pillars. SURVIVE the hunt... or be forgotten!"

In the center, a massive magical hourglass floats—ten segments of sand, each representing one round.
