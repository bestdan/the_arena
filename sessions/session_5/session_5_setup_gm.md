## Pre-Session Checklist

**Party Composition:**
- [[imwe|Imwe]] (Fighter, level 3, Phoenix-Blessed survivor)
- [[torgana|Torgana]] (Barbarian, level 3, Phoenix-Blessed survivor)
- [[father_crow|Father Crow]] (Cleric, level 3, Phoenix-Blessed survivor)
- 2 NEW PCs (level 3, fresh gladiators)

**Mechanics to Review:**
- [[crowds_favor|Crowd's Favor]] - still active; stealth and cleverness earn it differently here
- [[panache|Panache]] - can be used for dramatic ambushes or rescues
- [[last_stand|Last Stand]] - if someone gets announced and fails the save, they can Last Stand if conscious

**Key Resources:**
- 1 Darkvision Potion (party must decide who gets it)
- Standard starting equipment
- Any rewards/items from Session 4 resurrection

**Session Goal:**
Survive ten rounds without being announced and executed. Secondary goals: destroy pillars, kill hunters, maintain Favor for future bouts.

## Roleplaying Hooks

**For Phoenix-Blessed (Imwe, Torgana, Father Crow):**
- You've died and come back. How has that changed you?
- Do you feel responsibility to teach the newbies?
- Are you more cautious now, or more reckless?
- The crowd knows your names—is that an advantage or a liability?

**For New Gladiators:**
- Why are you here? Debt? Crime? Ambition?
- What do you think of these "Phoenix-Blessed" survivors?
- Do you believe the stories about the Rite of Phoenix Flames?
- How do you feel about being prey instead of predator?

**Group Dynamics:**
- Do you share the darkvision potion, or does one person hoard it?
- Do you use code names or risk your real names being heard?
- Do you stick together or split up to divide hunter attention?
- Do you go stealthy or loud (pillar destruction)?
