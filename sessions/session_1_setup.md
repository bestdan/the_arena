The portcullis raises, a cheer rises from the arena. 
**[Trumpets blare — a bit tinny. The crowd gives a half-hearted cheer.]**

```
“LADIES and GENTLEMEN… welcome back to the The Arena of Tarsus! Where blood meets sand, and glory is up for grabs—assuming someone can grab it!”


“Today’s midday trial brings us a fresh batch of hopefuls! Unproven. Unpolished. Possibly unlucky. But every legend starts somewhere, right?”

	**[He chuckles dryly, voice echoing in the open sun.]**

“So—will they rise to fame? Or fall face-first into the dirt? Only one way to find out!”

	**[He gestures toward the gates.]**

“From the Southern pens, we have the new bloods—barely out of their training pits, eyes full of dreams and just enough fear to make it interesting!”

	**[A slow cheer picks up—someone whistles.]**

“And from the other gates… well, let’s just say what’s coming for them doesn’t care how new they are.”

	**[Hoots and jeers]**

“So grab your watered wine, shade your eyes from the sun, and let’s see who earns their first drop of glory!”

	**[He raises his hand.]**

“Combatants! The Arena… awaits!”
```

Armored guards with spears nudge you forward. 

As you come out into the blinding sunlight, you're struck by the majesty of it. It's huge. The walls enclosing you are 30 feet tall. The spectators lean over - there's not much of a crowd, perhaps 100 people. The battle pit is enormous. 

There are rock formations in the dirt, giving you about 20 feet of height if you can scramble up it. 

You hear the creaking of gates in other parts of the pit, and the cheering begins. 

Charging around the corner are four wild boards. Their eyes are wild, (perception check) there's blood coming of their backs and hind legs. They see you all, and charge forward. 

Three particants die. 

```
**[The crowd murmurs — a few cheers, some polite applause. The announcer’s voice booms over the noise.]**

“Ha! Well done, well done! Our _new bloods_ have proven they can take down a pack of tusked brutes without becoming lunch! That’s… _something!_”

**[He gives a half-laugh, wiping his brow with a cloth.]**

“But don’t get too comfortable out there, little heroes. You’ve earned no rest yet — not in _this_ arena!”

**[He paces along the stands, voice tightening with showman’s tension.]**

“You thought the rocks were your salvation? Thought you could climb, hide, _rest?_”

**[He points toward the eastern gate, the crowd beginning to hush.]**

“Think again.”

**[A low, heavy scraping sound — claws on stone.]**

“Because next up… are the true lords of the rock and sun. Scaled, silent, and _hungry._”

**[The gate chains rattle — something hisses.]**

“Make way for the _lizard princes!_ Twice your size, ten times your patience, and not a single fear in their cold, beautiful hearts!”

**[He raises his voice as the beasts slither out.]**

“Let’s see how our warriors fight… when the ground itself turns against them!”

**[Crowd noise swells; the announcer grins into the chaos.]**

“Round two… _BEGIN!_”
```



```
**[The dust settles. The last of the lizards lies still. The crowd gives a ragged cheer — not wild, but real.]**

“Ha! And there it is! The sand drinks deep, but not _deep enough!_ Ten still stand!”

**[He lets the crowd’s noise roll a moment, then raises a hand for silence.]**

“You came in nameless. You leave… slightly _less_ nameless. You’ve survived your first taste of the arena — and that’s more than most ever do.”

**[He walks the edge of the pit, voice lowering, more personal now.]**

“The crowd sees you now. The patrons take note. Somewhere out there, a coin just changed hands — and a sponsor just found a favorite.”

**[He snaps his fingers; a few attendants begin to drag the fallen from the sand.]**

“Take your breath, champions. Patch your wounds. Today, you fought for your lives… next time, you’ll fight for your _names._”

**[He turns back toward the stands, voice rising again for one last note of theater.]**

“The blood dries, the gates close, and the sun sets on another fine afternoon in the _Grand Arena of Tarsus!_”

**[He pauses, as if he’s said it a hundred times, and adds with dry satisfaction:]**  
“Same time tomorrow, folks.”

Snak waits until the last of the bandages are tied before stomping into the room. She gives you a long, measuring look—like she’s still deciding whether you’re assets or meat.

“Not bad,” she growls. “Better than most first-timers. Word’s already spreading. Next bout? A few folks will show up to see _you_. Don’t let it get to your heads—you’re still replaceable. But they do love fresh hope.”

She tosses a small purse onto the table.  
“Torgana, Imwe—one silver each. Gladiator—three copper. Don’t spend it like idiots. Those apples - better than the stale bread, gone-off meat and gruel I'll be giving you.”

She jerks her chin toward the beds.  
“And you can thank your performance for those. You and that elf woman get the best cots in the place. She did pretty good too, she'll heal up quick. The others who only survived?” She snorts. “Floor sleepers. They’ll still be limping tomorrow, probably going into the next match half dead.”

Snak crosses her arms and becomes more serious.
“You’ll be bumped up to level two now. Expectations and your enemies go up too - it's only interesting if it's deadly. So—before next week—tell me if you want different steel in your hands. Blades, bows, something special. I’ll see what I can scrape together. No promises, but a good show needs good props.”

She turns to leave, pauses at the door.  
“Rest while you can. People will be watching next time - people worth being seen by.”
